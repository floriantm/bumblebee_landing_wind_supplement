abstract = {The approach phase of landing vespertilionid bats ends with a group of calls, which either consists of buzz I alone or buzz I and buzz II. To understand the possible role of buzz II, we trained Myotis myotis to land on a vertical grid, and compared the flight and echolocation behavior during approach in trials with and without buzz II. During the approach, we did not find any differences in the echolocation behavior until the end of buzz I which indicated whether buzz II was emitted or not. However, bats flying from the periphery of the flight channel, such that they had to make a small turn at the very last moment, finished the sequence with a buzz II. Bats flying on a rather stereotyped trajectory near the center of the flight channel without last instant corrections emitted buzz I alone. Our results indicate that buzz II occurred only on trajectories that implied a higher risk to fail at landing. The information delivered by buzz II reaches the bat too late to be used for landing. Therefore, we hypothesize that buzz II may help the bats to evaluate unsuccessful attempts and to eventually react adequately. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

The b1 typically fires once during every wing stroke near the time of the dorsal stroke reversal. The b2 fires either intermittenly or in bursts that may be elicited by a visual turning stimulus. Sustained activation of the b1 at rates near wing beat frequency appears necessary for tonic maintenance of stroke amplitude. In addition, advances in the phase of b1 activation were correlated with both increased wing protraction during the down-stroke and increased stroke amplitude. Similar kinematic alterations was correlated with b2 spikes, and consequently, both muscles may function in the control of turns toward the contralateral side. The effects of the two muscles were evident within a single stroke period and decayed quickly. Kinematic changes correlated with b1 phase shifts were graded, suggesting a role in compensatory course stabilization. In contrast, b2 spikes were correlated with all-or-none changes in the wing stroke, a characteristic consistent with a role in mediating rapid turns towards or away from objects.},

In the case of dipteran flight, a population of small steering muscles controls many of the subtle changes in wing kinematics that allow flies to maneuver rapidly. We filmed the wing motion of tethered Calliphora vicina at high speed and simultaneously recorded multi-channel electromyographic signals from some of the prominent steering muscles in order to correlate kinematics with muscle activity. Using this analysis, we found that the timing of each spike in the basalare muscles was strongly correlated with changes in the deviation of the stroke plane during the downstroke. The relationship was non-linear such that the magnitude of the kinematic response to each muscle spike decreased with increasing levels of stroke deviation. This result suggests that downstroke deviation is controlled in part via the mechanical summation of basalare activity. We also found that interactions among the basalares and muscles III2-III4 determine the maximum forward amplitude of the wingstroke. In addition, activity in muscle I1 appears to participate in a wingbeat gearing mechanism, as previously proposed. Using these results, we have been able to correlate changes in wing kinematics with alteration in the spike rate, firing phase and combinatorial activity of identified steering muscles.},

These longer response times are consistent with models of how visual neurons enhance sensitivity at low light intensities, but they could pose a challenge for moths feeding from swaying flowers.

abstract = {Summary
When approaching a landing surface, many flying animals use visual feedback to control their landing. Here, we studied how foraging bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) use radial optic expansion cues to control in-flight decelerations during landing. By analyzing the flight dynamics of 4,672 landing maneuvers, we showed that landing bumblebees exhibit a series of deceleration bouts, unlike landing honeybees that continuously decelerate. During each bout, the bumblebee keeps its relative rate of optical expansion constant, and from one bout to the next, the bumblebee tends to shift to a higher, constant relative rate of expansion. This modular landing strategy is relatively fast compared to the strategy described for honeybees and results in approach dynamics that is strikingly similar to that of pigeons and hummingbirds. The here discovered modular landing strategy of bumblebees helps explaining why these important pollinators in nature and horticulture can forage effectively in challenging conditions; moreover, it has potential for bio-inspired landing strategies in flying robots.},

Subsequently, we reverse engineered the transfer function mapping body pitch angle onto flight speed. A linear model is able to reproduce the behavioural data with good accuracy. Our results show that linearity in speed control is realized already at the level of body posture-mediated speed control and is therefore embodied at the level of the complex aero- dynamicmechanisms of body and wings. Together with previous results, this study reveals the existence of a linear hierarchical control strategy, which can provide relevant control principles for biomimetic implementations, such as autonomous flying micro air vehicles.},

abstract = {Abstract. The movement of the halteres during fixed flight was video recorded under stroboscopic illumina- tion phase coupled to the wing beat. The halteres swing in a rounded triangular manner through an angle of al- most 180 {\~{}} in vertical planes tilted backwards from the transverse plane by ca. 30 {\~{}} (Figs. 1, 2). The physics of the halteres are described in terms of a general formula for the force acting onto the endknob of the moving haltere during rotations and linear accelera- tions of the fly (Eq. 1). On the basis of the experimentally determined kinematics of the haltere, the primary forces and the forces dependent on angular velocity and on an- gular acceleration are calculated (Figs. 3, 4). Three distinct types of angular velocity dependent (Coriolis) forces are generated by rotations about 3 or- thogonal axes. Thus, in principle one haltere could detect all rotations in space (Fig. 6). The angular acceleration dependent forces have the same direction and frequency as the Coriolis forces, but they are shifted in phase by 90 {\~{}} . Thus, they could be evaluated in parallel and independently from the Coriolis forces. They are, however, much smaller than the Coriolis forces for oscillation frequencies of the fly up to 20 Hz (Fig. 5). From these considerations it is concluded that Coriolis forces play the major role in detecting body ro- tations.},

This hypothesis is based on a presumed trade-off between a low resting metabolism and adaptations of metabolism during activity. 2. With such a trade-off, selection to reduce resting metabolism is less intense in active species than in species where resting metabolism constitutes a large proportion of the daily metabolic costs. Those animals that spend more energy on activity should therefore have a higher resting metabolic rate than animals that spend less energy on activity. 3. A literature review reveals that flying insects have higher resting metabolic rates than species that use energetically less demanding types of locomotion. 4. Insects producing acoustic advertisement signals can be shown to have higher mass-independent resting metabolic rates than closely related species without this energetically demanding behaviour. 5. Literature data on vertebrate resting metabolic rates are also consistent with the presented hypothesis: the more energy animals spend on activity, the higher the mass-independent resting metabolic rate.},

abstract = {It has long been known that many flying insects use visual cues to orient with respect to the wind and to control their groundspeed in the face of varying wind conditions. Much less explored has been the role of mechanosensory cues in orienting insects relative to the ambient air. Here we show that Drosophila melanogaster, magnetically tethered so as to be able to rotate about their yaw axis, are able to detect and orient into a wind, as would be experienced during forward flight. Further, this behavior is velocity dependent and is likely subserved, at least in part, by the Johnston's organs, chordotonal organs in the antennae also involved in near-field sound detection. These wind-mediated responses may help to explain how flies are able to fly forward despite visual responses that might otherwise inhibit this behavior. Expanding visual stimuli, such as are encountered during forward flight, are the most potent aversive visual cues known for D. melanogaster flying in a tethered paradigm. Accordingly, tethered flies strongly orient towards a focus of contraction, a problematic situation for any animal attempting to fly forward. We show in this study that wind stimuli, transduced via mechanosensory means, can compensate for the aversion to visual expansion and thus may help to explain how these animals are indeed able to maintain forward flight.},

abstract = {Vision is arguably the most widely used sensor for position and velocity estimation in animals, and it is increasingly used in robotic systems as well. Many animals use stereopsis and object recognition in order to make a true estimate of distance. For a tiny insect such as a fruit fly or honeybee, however, these methods fall short. Instead, an insect must rely on calculations of optic flow, which can provide a measure of the ratio of velocity to distance, but not either parameter independently. Nevertheless, flies and other insects are adept at landing on a variety of substrates, a behavior that inherently requires some form of distance estimation in order to trigger distance-appropriate motor actions such as deceleration or leg extension. Previous studies have shown that these behaviors are indeed under visual control, raising the question: how does an insect estimate distance solely using optic flow? In this paper we use a nonlinear control theoretic approach to propose a solution for this problem. Our algorithm takes advantage of visually controlled landing trajectories that have been observed in flies and honeybees. Finally, we implement our algorithm, which we term dynamic peering, using a camera mounted to a linear stage to demonstrate its real-world feasibility. {\textcopyright} 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Flying is an ecologically important behaviour in many insects, but it often results in permanent wing damage. Although wing wear in insects is often used as a method to determine insect age, and is associated with an increased risk of mortality, the causes of wing wear are unresolved. In this paper, we examine whether wing use while foraging explains wing wear in bumble bees (Bombus spp.). Wing wear may result from three distinct flight characteristics during foraging: time spent in flight, flight frequency and frequency of wing collisions with vegetation. To test these hypotheses for causes of wing wear, we recorded digital video of individually marked bumble bees foraging in nature on 12 different plant species thatresult in variation in these flight characteristics, and recaptured these individuals to photograph their wings over time.Bumble bees with a higher frequency of wing collisions showed an increased loss of wing area, which became more severe over time. Neither time in flight nor flight frequency was uniquely and significantly associated with wing wear. Therefore, the collision frequency hypothesis best explained wing wear in bumble bees. We conclude that wing use during foraging in bumble bees results in wing wear. Wing wear reflects behaviour, not simply age. Because wing wear has elsewhere been shown to increase mortality, this study provides an important mechanism linking foraging behaviour with lifespan. {\textcopyright} 2011.

However, the role of wind in determining patterns of bee abundance and floral visitation rates across space and time is not well understood. Orchid bees are an important and diverse group of neotropical pollinators that harvest pollen, nectar and resin from plants. In addition, male orchid bees collect volatile scents that they store in special chambers in their hind legs, and for which the wind-based dispersal of odours may play a particularly crucial role. Here, we take advantage of this specialized scent foraging behaviour to study the effects of wind on orchid bee visitation at scent sources in a fragmented tropical forest ecosystem. Consistent with previous work, forest cover increased orchid bee visitation. In addition, we find that temporal changes in wind speed and turbulence increase visitation to scent stations within sites. These results suggest that the increased dispersal of attractive scents provided by wind and turbulence outweighs any biomechanical or energetic costs that might deter bees from foraging in these conditions. Overall, our results highlight the significance of wind in the ecology of these important pollinators in neotropical forests.},

abstract = {Bees navigate in complex environments using visual, olfactory and mechano-sensorial cues. In the lowest region of the atmosphere the wind environment can be highly unsteady and bees employ fine motor-skills to enhance flight control. Recent work reveals sophisticated multi-modal processing of visual and olfactory channels by the bee brain to enhance foraging efficiency, but it currently remains unclear if wind-induced mechano-sensory inputs are also integrated with visual information to facilitate decision making. Individual honeybees were trained in a linear flight arena with appetitive-aversive differential conditioning to use a context setting cue of 3 m s(-1) cross-wind direction to enable decisions about either a 'blue' or 'yellow' star stimulus being the correct alternative. Colour stimuli properties were mapped in bee-specific opponent-colour spaces to validate saliency, and to thus enable rapid reverse learning. Bees were able to integrate mechano-sensory and visual information to facilitate decisions that were significantly different to chance expectation after 35 learning trials. An independent group of bees were trained to find a single rewarding colour that was unrelated to the wind direction. In these trials wind was not used as a context-setting cue and served only as a potential distracter in identifying the relevant rewarding visual stimuli. Comparing between respective groups shows that bees can learn to integrate visual and mechano-sensory information in a non-elemental fashion, revealing an unsuspected level of sensory processing in honeybees, and adding to the growing body of knowledge on the capacity of insect brains to use multi-modal sensory inputs in mediating foraging behaviour.},

abstract = {Flying insects are able to fly smartly in an unpredictable environment. It has been found that flying insects have smart neurons inside their tiny brains that are sensitive to visual motion also called optic flow. Consequently, flying insects rely mainly on visual motion during their flight maneuvers such as: takeoff or landing, terrain following, tunnel crossing, lateral and frontal obstacle avoidance, and adjusting flight speed in a cluttered environment. Optic flow can be defined as the vector field of the apparent motion of objects, surfaces, and edges in a visual scene generated by the relative motion between an observer (an eye or a camera) and the scene. Translational optic flow is particularly interesting for short-range navigation because it depends on the ratio between (i) the relative linear speed of the visual scene with respect to the observer and (ii) the distance of the observer from obstacles in the surrounding environment without any direct measurement of either speed or distance. In flying insects, roll stabilization reflex and yaw saccades attenuate any rotation at the eye level in roll and yaw respectively (i.e. to cancel any rotational optic flow) in order to ensure pure translational optic flow between two successive saccades. Our survey focuses on feedback-loops which use the translational optic flow that insects employ for collision-free navigation. Optic flow is likely, over the next decade to be one of the most important visual cues that can explain flying insects' behaviors for short-range navigation maneuvers in complex tunnels. Conversely, the biorobotic approach can therefore help to develop innovative flight control systems for flying robots with the aim of mimicking flying insects' abilities and better understanding their flight.},

abstract = {The longitudinal dynamic flight stability of a bumblebee in forward flight is studied. The method of computational fluid dynamics is used to compute the aerodynamic derivatives and the techniques of eigenvalue and eigenvector analysis are employed for solving the equations of motion. The primary findings are as the following. The forward flight of the bumblebee is not dynamically stable due to the existence of one (or two) unstable or approximately neutrally stable natural modes of motion. At hovering to medium flight speed [flight speed u(e) = (0-3.5) m s(-1); advance ratio J = 0-0.44], the flight is weakly unstable or approximately neutrally stable; at high speed (u (e) = 4.5 m s(-1); J = 0.57), the flight becomes strongly unstable (initial disturbance double its value in only 3.5 wingbeats).},

Here we show that flapping fliers ranging in size from fruit flies to large birds benefit from substantial damping of angular velocity through a passive mechanism termed flapping counter-torque (FCT). Our FCT model predicts that isometrically scaled animals experience similar damping on a per-wingbeat time scale, resulting in similar turning dynamics in wingbeat time regardless of body size. The model also shows how animals may simultaneously specialize in both maneuverability and stability (at the cost of efficiency) and provides a framework for linking morphology, wing kinematics, maneuverability, and flight dynamics across a wide range of flying animals spanning insects, bats, and birds.},

Wind speeds were measured 7 m. from the ground; bees were regarded as flying with or against the wind according to whether the wind struck them at angles of 135 - 180° or 0 -45° from the flight path. Winds at 45 - 90° were not considered; those at 90-135° were regarded as neutral winds. Wind affected speed of flight, but much less than if wind speed were simply superimposed on a constant air speed. Regression lines gave ground speeds of 75 and 65 m./sec. respectively for unloaded and loaded bees, the difference being significant (P{\textless}0.001); in neutral winds these speeds were 78 and 70 m./sec. respectively. At wind speeds above 4 m./sec. bees flew just above the ground instead of at 7-8 m., and thus maintained a fairly constant ground speed. Bees foraging at 420 m. spent less time feeding, and more in the hive (average differences -16 sec., +20 sec.) than bees foraging at 210 m.},

abstract = {Monocular vision is increasingly used in micro air vehicles for navigation. In particular, optical flow, inspired by flying insects, is used to perceive vehicle movement with respect to the surroundings or sense changes in the environment. However, optical flow does not directly provide us the distance to an object or velocity, but the ratio of them. Thus, using optical flow in control involves nonlinearity problems which add complexity to the controller. To deal with that, we propose an algorithm that estimates distance and velocity of the vehicle based on optical flow measured from a monocular camera and the knowledge of control inputs. This algorithm applies an extended Kalman filter to state estimation and uses the estimates for landing control. We implement and test our algorithm in computer simulation and on board a Parrot AR.Drone 2.0 to demonstrate its feasibility for micro air vehicles landings. Results of the simulation and multiple flight tests show that the algorithm is able to estimate height and velocity of the micro air vehicles accurately, and achieves smooth landings with these estimates, even in windy outdoor environments.},

abstract = {There is now increasing evidence that honey bees regulate their ground speed in flight by holding constant the speed at which the image of the environment moves across the eye (optic flow). We have investigated the extent to which ground speed is affected by headwinds. Honey bees were trained to enter a tunnel to forage at a sucrose feeder placed at its far end. Ground speeds in the tunnel were recorded while systematically varying the visual texture of the tunnel, and the strength of headwinds experienced by the flying bees. We found that in a flight tunnel bees used visual cues to maintain their ground speed, and adjusted their air speed to maintain a constant rate of optic flow, even against headwinds which were, at their strongest, 50{\%} of a bee's maximum recorded forward velocity. Manipulation of the visual texture revealed that headwind is compensated almost fully even when the optic flow cues are very sparse and subtle, demonstrating the robustness of this visual flight control system. We discuss these findings in the context of field observations of flying bees.},

abstract = {Although the principal mechanisms of insect flight are well understood, knowledge  about the influence of environmental factors on flight performance is scarce. We show that ambient temperature (TA) and illuminance have an influence on the flight performance of hornets. Moreover, the regulation of flight speed at different environmental conditions is sex specific. In roundabout experiments with tethered hornets, the flight speed of workers was independent of TA, while that of drones was negatively correlated with TA. We hypothesize that the reasons for these differences may lie in sex-specific cooling mechanisms; workers might regulate their body temperature through forced heat loss, whereas drones might reduce their heat production rates. At low illuminance, workers reduced their flight speed, whereas drones did not. Reduced flight speed at low illuminances is probably a behavioral mechanism of compensation for disadvantages caused by changing neuronal processes in the sensory neurons in darkness.},

abstract = {In the absence of much passive stability, flying insects rely upon active stabilisation, necessitating the provision of rich sensory feedback across a range of modalities. Here we consider from a sensory perspective what quantities flying insects measure, in order to ask from a mechanical perspective why they should want to do so. We consider each of the sensory modalities separately and uncover three general principles. Firstly, we find that insects have evolved to measure changes in kinematic state, rather than absolute state. For example, although the antennae may be loosely thought of as airspeed sensors, we show that they are configured as a sophisticated adaptive sensing system which is much more appropriate for measuring changes in airspeed than absolute airspeed. Secondly, we find that insect sensory systems are tuned to sense self-motion components in specific directions. For example, certain visual interneurons of flies operate as matched filters that are tuned to detect the optic flow fields induced specifically by rotation about one particular axis. Thirdly, we find that insects commonly combine sensory input from across modalities to form composite, multi-modal quantities which they use as feedback to the control system. For example, certain individually identified descending interneurons combine input from the compound eyes, ocelli, antennae, and cephalic wind-sensitive hairs into one composite signal which is then used in flight control. We infer from these three general organisational principles that insects are configured to sense excitation of their natural modes of motion. This natural-mode sensing hypothesis: (1) explains why insects should want to sense changes in state rather than absolute state; (2) predicts what specific directions of motion they should sense, and (3) specifies how sensory input from different modalities should be combined. {\textcopyright}2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Virtual immersive environments or telepresence setups often consist of multiple cameras that have to be calibrated. We present a convenient method for doing this. The minimum is three cameras, but there is no upper limit. The method is fully automatic and a freely moving bright spot is the only calibration object. A set of virtual 3D points is made by waving the bright spot through the working volume. Its projections are found with subpixel precision and verified by a robust RANSAC analysis. The cameras do not have to see all points; only reasonable overlap between camera subgroups is necessary. Projective structures are computed via rank-4 factorization and the Euclidean stratification is done by imposing geometric constraints. This linear estimate initializes a postprocessing computation of nonlinear distortion, which is also fully automatic. We suggest a trick on how to use a very ordinary laser pointer as the calibration object. We show that it is possible to calibrate an immersive virtual environment with 16 cameras in less than 60 minutes reaching about 1/5 pixel reprojection error. The method has been successfully tested on numerous multicamera environments using varying numbers of cameras of varying quality. {\textcopyright} 2005 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

abstract = {Airflow conditions close to the Earth's surface are often complex, posing challenges to flight stability and control for volant taxa. Relatively little is known about how well flying animals can contend with complex, adverse air flows, or about the flight control mechanisms used by animals to mitigate wind disturbances. Several recent studies have examined flight in the unsteady von K{\'{a}}rm{\'{a}}n vortex streets that form behind cylinders, generating flow disturbances that are predictable in space and time; these structures are relatively rare in nature, because they occur only the immediate, downstream vicinity of an object. In contrast, freestream turbulence is characterized by rapid, unpredictable flow disturbances across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, and is nearly ubiquitous in natural habitats. Hummingbirds are ideal organisms for studying the influence of freestream turbulence on flight, as they forage in a variety of aerial conditions and are powerful flyers. We filmed ruby-throated hummingbirds (Archilochus colubris) maintaining position at a feeder in laminar and strongly turbulent (intensity ∼15{\%}) airflow environments within a wind tunnel and compared their mean kinematics of the head, body, tail and wing, as well as variability in these parameters. Hummingbirds exhibited remarkably stable head position and orientation in both smooth and turbulent flow while maintaining position at the feeder. However, the hummingbird's body was less stable in turbulent flow and appeared to be most sensitive to disturbances along the mediolateral axis, displaying large lateral accelerations, translations and rolling motions during flight. The hummingbirds mitigated these disturbances by increasing mean wing stroke amplitude and stroke plane angle, and by varying these parameters asymmetrically between the wings and from one stroke to the next. They also actively varied the orientation and fan angle of the tail, maintaining a larger mean fan angle when flying in turbulent flow; this may improve their passive stability, but probably incurs an energetic cost as a result of increased drag. Overall, we observed many of the same kinematic changes noted previously for hummingbirds flying in a von K{\'{a}}rm{\'{a}}n vortex street, but we also observed kinematic changes associated with high force production, similar to those seen during load-lifting or high-speed flight. These findings suggest that flight may be particularly costly in fully mixed, freestream turbulence, which is the flow condition that hummingbirds are likely to encounter most frequently in natural habitats.},

abstract = {The equations of motion associated with flapping flight differ from the rigid body equations in that the moments of inertia and center of gravity location change significantly for each stroke of the wings. Mass properties of each component of a flapping vehicle are generally measurable and constant. That is, each wing and the body has a particular mass, center of gravity location, and moments/products of inertia about its own reference axes. Thus, it is desirable to develop a system of equations, which describe the motion of the flapping vehicle using properties that are constant and measurable. The motion of the wings of a flapping vehicle is specified by parameters at the root of each wing. The angular positions of the wing relative to the body (three Euler angles) determine the relationship of the wing to the body. The equations are written so that these Euler angles can be specified to provide wing motions that generate the lift and propulsion for the vehicle.},

abstract = {This paper offers a quick review of the subject of "optic flow" in its conceptual and computational aspects. The theory is evaluated in terms of possible applications in the neurophysiology and experimental psychology of spatial sensorymotor behaviour and perception. The problem of which kind of detector is suited to extract various aspects of optic flow is given special attention. It is shown that the possibilities are actually much more various than is reflected in the current (even the frankly speculative) literature. It is argued that a system that is sensitive to the relative time changes of the orientation differences of image details is especially suited for an analysis of the optic flow with regard to the information concerning the three dimensional shape of objects such as is contained in the flow. Thus the orientation sensitive elements that are known to be abundantly present in the primary visual cortex of many vertebrates are hereby implicated as a quite likely substrate for the extraction of the solid shape of environmental objects. In our opinion this possibility should be investigated with the same ardour as the usual interpretation, which holds this system responsible for the initial extraction of the contours of flat (i.e. defined in the image) shapes. A new, partial solution to the "structure from motion problem" is offered, that not only covers the usual case of shape extraction in the presence of rigid motions of the object, but also the much wider class of (non-rigid) bending deformations (such as occur in the non-rigid deformations of inextensible shells). These solutions violate all conditions required by the well known "structure from motion theorem": the solutions are possible for point configurations in which no fourtuple of points moves as a rigid structure and for input data from merely two views. A numerical example illustrates how this algorithm can be used to predict side views of an object from very limited input data. {\textcopyright} 1986.},

abstract = {The longitudinal dynamic flight stability of a hovering bumblebee was studied using the method of computational fluid dynamics to compute the aerodynamic derivatives and the techniques of eigenvalue and eigenvector analysis for solving the equations of motion. For the longitudinal disturbed motion, three natural modes were identified: one unstable oscillatory mode, one stable fast subsidence mode and one stable slow subsidence mode. The unstable oscillatory mode consists of pitching and horizontal moving oscillations with negligible vertical motion. The period of the oscillations is 0.32 s (approx. 50 times the wingbeat period of the bumblebee). The oscillations double in amplitude in 0.1 s; coupling of nose-up pitching with forward horizontal motion (and nose-down pitching with backward horizontal motion) in this mode causes the instability. The stable fast subsidence mode consists of monotonic pitching and horizontal motions, which decay to half of the starting values in 0.024 s. The stable slow subsidence mode is mainly a monotonic descending (or ascending) motion, which decays to half of its starting value in 0.37 s. Due to the unstable oscillatory mode, the hovering flight of the bumblebee is dynamically unstable. However, the instability might not be a great problem to a bumblebee that tries to stay hovering: the time for the initial disturbances to double (0.1 s) is more than 15 times the wingbeat period (6.4 ms), and the bumblebee has plenty of time to adjust its wing motion before the disturbances grow large.},

abstract = {The relationship between flight power ana airspeed of birds, as derived from flight mechanical theory, can be used to predict the maximum range speed Vmr which is the optimal speed for minimizing the cost of transport. This speed is not constant but depends on the winds. Earlier predictions about the optimal adjustment of flight speed by birds in relation to winds are only valid in due head- and tailwind situations. We derive Vmr for birds flying along a constant track direction with an arbitrary wind. It emerges that the effect of sidewinds on Vmr depends on the marginal rate of return in groundspeed with an increasing airspeed. This marginal rate increases with the angle between the bird's track and heading direction. Hence, Vmr not only depends on the effect of wind on the bird's actual groundspeed but also on the bird's angle of compensation for the sidewinds. As a result, optimal light speeds are faster in sidewinds than in tail- or headwinds with a corresponding speed-increment caused by wind. The adjustments of optimal airspeed in relation to sidewinds will be analogous also for other characteristic flight speeds besides Vmr, such as the optimal flight speed associated with time-saving rather than energy-saving migration, and with food searching, flight between foraging patches and food delivery flights. We also discuss requirements for empirical tests of the predictions proposed in this paper. {\textcopyright} 1994 Academic Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {To make a smooth touchdown when landing, an insect must be able to reliably control its approach speed as well as its body and leg position—behaviors that are thought to be regulated primarily by visual information. Bumblebees forage and land under a broad range of light intensities and while their behavior during the final moments of landing has been described in detail in bright light, little is known about how this is affected by decreasing light intensity. Here, we investigate this by characterizing the performance of bumblebees, B. terrestris, landing on a flat platform at two different orientations (horizontal and vertical) and at four different light intensities (ranging from 600 lx down to 19 lx). As light intensity decreased, the bees modified their body position and the distance at which they extended their legs, suggesting that the control of landing in these insects is visually mediated. Nevertheless, the effect of light intensity was small and the landings were still well controlled, even in the dimmest light. We suggest that the changes in landing behavior that occurred in dim light might represent adaptations that allow the bees to perform smooth landings across the broad range of light intensities at which they are active.},

abstract = {Like their diurnal relatives, Megalopta genalis use visual information to control flight. Unlike their diurnal relatives, however, they do this at extremely low light intensities. Although Megalopta has developed optical specializations to increase visual sensitivity, theoretical studies suggest that this enhanced sensitivity does not enable them to capture enough light to use visual information to reliably control flight in the rainforest at night. It has been proposed that Megalopta gain extra sensitivity by summing visual information over time. While enhancing the reliability of vision, this strategy would decrease the accuracy with which they can detect image motion-a crucial cue for flight control. Here, we test this temporal summation hypothesis by investigating how Megalopta's flight control and landing precision is affected by light intensity and compare our findings with the results of similar experiments performed on the diurnal bumblebee Bombus terrestris, to explore the extent to which Megalopta's adaptations to dim light affect their precision. We find that, unlike Bombus, light intensity does not affect flight and landing precision in Megalopta. Overall, we find little evidence that Megalopta uses a temporal summation strategy in dim light, while we find strong support for the use of this strategy in Bombus.},

More than 60{\%} of the observation period around noon they spent outside the hive. When foragers were prevented from flight by the lack of light or by bad weather, they showed long periods that were defined as unproductive and trophallactic contacts were reduced. Nurses aged 7-9 days showed a less pronounced behavioural difference between day and night but were highly sensitive to weather alterations. They spent less than half of the time nursing the brood during bad weather conditions compared to good weather conditions, although there was no lack of pollen and honey in the colony. The same tendency was observed in other nurse-related activities. They were less often fed by other bees during days with bad weather conditions than during days with good weather conditions. These dramatic changes in behaviour could be observed even on the first day of rain. We presume that the decline of activity is at least partly caused by the diminishing flow of food within a colony.},

The blowfly (green bottles, blue bottles or carrion flies), is a well known scavenger insects and primary insects commonly utilized to indicate a post-mortem interval. Due to its importance as a death indicator in forensic entomology, a considerable amount of data on its growth and development has been generated. This experiment was conducted in two steps. In step 1, fresh meat was exposed to collect the eggs which were reared and used to study the biology of blowfly. Calculating the age of different life stages of blowfly, hourly developmental data is presented i-e eggs hatched in 16 hours while all the three instars of larvae took 92 hours followed by the pupal stage which was 336 hours. Adult's life was recorded 192 hours. In this way the total duration was recorded 636 hours. In step 2, to study the food consumption of blowfly maggots, three plastic jars provided each with known amount of meat and 10 active feeding 1 st instar larvae were placed in an incubator at a constant temperature and relative humidity. The average meat consumed by 10 larvae was 19.3 gm and the average meat consumed per larvae was recorded 1.93 gm. This report recommends the study of biology of blowflies on different feeding sources plus growth rates and food consumption rate of blowfly maggots on different body tissues or food sources.},

abstract = {Wind is an important yet understudied environmental influence on foraging behaviour. We investigated the direct and indirect effects of wind on foraging worker honey bees, Apis mellifera. Bees were trained to an array of artificial flowers providing nectar rewards in a location sheltered from natural wind. To examine the direct effect, fans produced four different wind speeds between 0 and 3 m/s at three different flower spacings: 5 cm (flowers touching) and 10 cm and 20 cm (flowers not touching). To examine the indirect effect of wind moving flowers, flowers were moved 10 cm at three frequencies between 50 and 110 cycles/min at zero wind speed. We recorded the number of successful flower visits, time spent flying, search time on a flower and hesitancy to take off. Bees visited significantly fewer flowers with increasing wind speed which was caused by a significant increase in hesitancy to take off. This difference in flower visits between wind speeds was highest at the 20 cm spacing. Flower movement had no effect on foraging rate; however, there was a significant positive relationship between flower movement and the total time spent flying. This was counterbalanced by a significant reduction in time spent searching for the nectary after landing on a flower at the higher flower frequencies. Our results suggest that it is the direct effect of wind on hesitancy to take off that has the greatest effect on honey bee foraging rate.},

Although optic flow plays an essential role in speed determination, it is less reliable under conditions of low light or sparse landmarks. Under such conditions, insects rely on feedback from antennal mechanosensors but it is not clear how these inputs combine to elicit flight-related antennal behaviours. We here show that antennal movements of the honeybee, Apis mellifera, are governed by combined visual and antennal mechanosensory inputs. Frontal airflow, as experienced during forward flight, causes antennae to actively move forward as a sigmoidal function of absolute airspeed values. However, corresponding front-to-back optic-flow causes antennae to move backward, as a linear function of relative optic flow, opposite the airspeed response. When combined, these inputs maintain antennal position in a state of dynamic equilibrium.},

abstract = {Using 3D infrared high-speed video, we captured the continuous wing and body kinematics of free-flying fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, during hovering and slow forward flight. We then `replayed' the wing kinematics on a dynamically scaled robotic model to measure the aerodynamic forces produced by the wings. Hovering animals generate a U-shaped wing trajectory, in which large drag forces during a downward plunge at the start of each stroke create peak vertical forces. Quasi-steady mechanisms could account for nearly all of the mean measured force required to hover, although temporal discrepancies between instantaneous measured forces and model predictions indicate that unsteady mechanisms also play a significant role. We analyzed the requirements for hovering from an analysis of the time history of forces and moments in all six degrees of freedom. The wing kinematics necessary to generate sufficient lift are highly constrained by the requirement to balance thrust and pitch torque over the stroke cycle. We also compare the wing motion and aerodynamic forces of free and tethered flies. Tethering causes a strong distortion of the stroke pattern that results in a reduction of translational forces and a prominent nose-down pitch moment. The stereotyped distortion under tethered conditions is most likely due to a disruption of sensory feedback. Finally, we calculated flight power based directly on the measurements of wing motion and aerodynamic forces, which yielded a higher estimate of muscle power during free hovering flight than prior estimates based on time-averaged parameters. This discrepancy is mostly due to a two- to threefold underestimate of the mean profile drag coefficient in prior studies. We also compared our values with the predictions of the same time-averaged models using more accurate kinematic and aerodynamic input parameters based on our high-speed videography measurements. In this case, the time-averaged models tended to overestimate flight costs.},

abstract = {Bees use visual memories to find the spatial location of previously learnt food sites. Characteristic learning flights help acquiring these memories at newly discovered foraging locations where landmarks-salient objects in the vicinity of the goal location-can play an important role in guiding the animal's homing behavior. Although behavioral experiments have shown that bees can use a variety of visual cues to distinguish objects as landmarks, the question of how landmark features are encoded by the visual system is still open. Recently, it could be shown that motion cues are sufficient to allow bees localizing their goal using landmarks that can hardly be discriminated from the background texture. Here, we tested the hypothesis that motion sensitive neurons in the bee's visual pathway provide information about such landmarks during a learning flight and might, thus, play a role for goal localization. We tracked learning flights of free-flying bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) in an arena with distinct visual landmarks, reconstructed the visual input during these flights, and replayed ego-perspective movies to tethered bumblebees while recording the activity of direction-selective wide-field neurons in their optic lobe. By comparing neuronal responses during a typical learning flight and targeted modifications of landmark properties in this movie we demonstrate that these objects are indeed represented in the bee's visual motion pathway. We find that object-induced responses vary little with object texture, which is in agreement with behavioral evidence. These neurons thus convey information about landmark properties that are useful for view-based homing.},

abstract = { To minimize the risk of colliding with the ground or other obstacles, flying animals need to control both their ground speed and ground height. This task is particularly challenging in wind, where head winds require an animal to increase its airspeed to maintain a constant ground speed and tail winds may generate negative airspeeds, rendering flight more difficult to control. In this study, we investigate how head and tail winds affect flight control in the honeybee Apis mellifera , which is known to rely on the pattern of visual motion generated across the eye—known as optic flow—to maintain constant ground speeds and heights. We find that, when provided with both longitudinal and transverse optic flow cues (in or perpendicular to the direction of flight, respectively), honeybees maintain a constant ground speed but fly lower in head winds and higher in tail winds, a response that is also observed when longitudinal optic flow cues are minimized. When the transverse component of optic flow is minimized, or when all optic flow cues are minimized, the effect of wind on ground height is abolished. We propose that the regular sidewards oscillations that the bees make as they fly may be used to extract information about the distance to the ground, independently of the longitudinal optic flow that they use for ground speed control. This computationally simple strategy could have potential uses in the development of lightweight and robust systems for guiding autonomous flying vehicles in natural environments. },

However, the impact of human-induced biodiversity loss on the functioning of plant-pollinator interactions has not been tested experimentally. To understand how plant communities respond to diversity changes in their pollinating fauna, we manipulated the functional diversity of both plants and pollinators under natural conditions. Increasing the functional diversity of both plants and pollinators led to the recruitment of more diverse plant communities. After two years the plant communities pollinated by the most functionally diverse pollinator assemblage contained about 50{\%} more plant species than did plant communities pollinated by less-diverse pollinator assemblages. Moreover, the positive effect of functional diversity was explained by a complementarity between functional groups of pollinators and plants. Thus, the functional diversity of pollination networks may be critical to ecosystem sustainability. {\textcopyright} 2006 Fontaine et al.},

abstract = {More than 25{\%} of accidents are rear-end collisions. It is essential to identify the factors that contribute to such collisions. One such factor is a driver's ability to respond to the deceleration of the car ahead. In Experiment 1, we measured effects of optic flow information and discrete visual and auditory warnings (brake lights, tones) on responses to deceleration during car following. With computer simulations of car-following scenes, university students pressed a button when the lead car decelerated. Both classes of information affected responses. Observers relied on discrete warnings when optic flow information was relatively less effective as determined by the lead car's headway and deceleration rate. This is consistent with DeLucia's (2008) conceptual framework of space perception that emphasized the importance of viewing distance and motion (and task). In Experiment 2, we measured responses to deceleration after a visual interruption. Scenes were designed to tease apart the role of expectations and optic flow. Responses mostly were consistent with optic flow information presented after the interruption rather than with putative mental expectations that were set up by the lead car's motion prior to the interruption. The theoretical implication of the present results is that responses to deceleration are based on multiple sources of information, including optical size, optical expansion rate and tau, and discrete warnings that are independent of optic flow. The practical implication is that in-vehicle collision-avoidance warning systems may be more useful when optic flow is less effective (e.g., slow deceleration rates), implicating a role for adaptive collision-warning systems. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Psychological Association.},

abstract = {Biologists proposed the tau theory to explain how animals control their motion using visual feedback for different tasks including landing and perching. Tau theory is based on a concept called time-to-contact, which is the required time to contact an object if the current velocity is maintained. Recently, tau theory has been applied to control robots' motion for similar tasks such as perching, docking, braking, or landing. However, existing tau theory can only work for the case with zero contact velocity. Some tasks such as perching actually require a non-zero contact velocity to make gripping mechanisms work. To address this problem, we extend the tau theory by proposing a two-stage strategy in one dimensional space to generate the reference trajectory for time-to-contact. Moreover, we propose a new coupling strategy to deal with the motion in three dimensional space. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed two-stage and coupling strategies. Moreover, we leverage a featureless method to estimate the time-to-contact from image sequences and implement it on a mobile robot platform. Experimental results also demonstrate that the non-zero contact velocity can be accomplished using onboard vision feedback. The research presented in this paper can be readily applied to control the motion of flying robots for perching with visual feedback.},

As the size of a flyer is reduced, the wing-to-body mass ratio tends to decrease as well. Furthermore, these flyers use integrated system consisting of wings to generate aerodynamic forces, muscles to move the wings, and sensing and control systems to guide and manoeuvre. In this article, recent advances in insect-scale flapping-wing aerodynamics, flexible wing structures, unsteady flight environment, sensing, stability and control are reviewed with perspective offered.

abstract = {Male gypsy moths (Lymantria dispar L.) are able to control their forward flight speed solely by means of optical cues derived from the lateral parts of their visual field. Thereby, relative motion of the objects is required, which under free flight conditions would derive from the self-induced motion of the stationary objects within a surrounding structured in depth. Besides this “motion parallax”, however, the control system for forward flight speed demands figural properties of the objects such as differences in their angular extension or contrast. In a natural surround, the images of objects closer to the moth have higher angular velocity and, in addition, are usually larger and have higher contrast than those of objects farther away. The experiments have shown that this natural pairing of angular velocity and figural properties is essential to induce a thrust response which appears suitable to counteract involuntary changes in forward flight speed, as e.g. caused by changes in wind speed under free flight conditions. Inverse pairing of the visual stimuli caused the moths to either enlarge the error signal according to positive feedback within the control circuit, or to increase thrust to a maximum as always found in experiments without motion parallax or in the absence of differences in figural properties. The open-loop experiments furthermore established that the set point of angular velocity of the closer objects lies within the range of 4.5–9°/s, and that pattern speed modulation has to cover this range in order to induce a compensatory thrust modulation. The response is largely independent of the magnitude of relative motion as long as it is present; the response amplitude, however, strongly depends on the amplitude of pattern speed modulation. The results are discussed with regard to other visual cues used for the control of forward flight speed in insects, the algorithm underlying the figure-ground discrimination in flies, and the perception of depth in man as known from psychophysical experiments.},

abstract = {We systematically investigated the effect of body rotation on the aerodynamic torque generation on flapping wings during fast turning maneuvers (body saccades) in the fruit fly Drosophila. A quasi-steady aerodynamic simulation of turning maneuvers with symmetrically flapping wings showed that body rotation causes a substantial aerodynamic counter-torque, known as flapping counter-torque (FCT), which acts in the opposite direction to turning. Simulation results further indicate that FCTs are linearly dependent on the rotational velocity and the flapping frequency regardless of the kinematics of wing motion. We estimated the damping coefficients for the principal rotation axes — roll, pitch, yaw — in the stroke plane frame. FCT-induced passive damping exists about all the rotation axes examined, suggesting that the effects of body rotation cannot be ignored in the analysis of free-flight dynamics. Force measurements on a dynamically scaled robotic wing undergoing realistic saccade kinematics showed that although passive aerodynamic damping due to FCT can account for a large part of the deceleration during saccades, active yaw torque from asymmetric wing motion is required to terminate body rotation. In addition, we calculated the mean value of the damping coefficient at 21.00 ×10−12 N m s based on free-flight data of saccades, which is somewhat lower than that estimated by the simulation results (26.84×10−12 N m s). mean chord lengthCDdrag coefficientCi—jdamping coefficient about i axis during rotation about j axisCNnormal force coefficientmbody massnflapping frequency(S)non-dimensional first moment of wing area(S)non-dimensional second moment of wing areanormalized center of pressure on the wingRwing lengthReReynolds numberSwing areanon-dimensional timevxsforward/backward velocity in the stroke plane framexbbody roll axisxsroll axis in the stroke plane frameybbody pitch axisyspitch axis in the stroke plane framezbbody yaw axiszsyaw axis in the stroke plane frame{\$}\alpha{\$}angle of attack{\$}\theta{\$}stroke deviation{\$}\Theta{\$}maximum stroke deviation{\$}\Theta{\$}0offset of stroke deviation{\$}\nu{\$}kinematic viscosity{\$}\rho{\$}fluid/air density{\$}\tau{\$}pitchFCT during pitch rotation{\$}\tau{\$}rollFCT during roll rotation{\$}\tau{\$}yawFCT during yaw rotationϕstroke angle{\$}\phi{\$}rotation angle{\$}\Phi{\$}flapping amplitude{\$}\Psi{\$}maximum rotation angle{\$}\chi{\$}0free body angle{\$}\omega{\$}xsroll angular velocity in the stroke plane frame{\$}\omega{\$}yspitch angular velocity in the stroke plane frame{\$}\omega{\$}zsyaw angular velocity in the stroke plane frame},

abstract = {This paper presents a framework for simulating the flight dynamics and control strategies of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. The framework consists of five main components; an articulated rigid-body simulation, a model of the aerodynamic forces and moments, a sensory systems model, a control model, and an environment model. In the rigid-body simulation the fly is represented by a system of three rigid-bodies connected by a pair of actuated ball-joints. At each instant of the simulation, the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on the wings and body of the fly are calculated using an empirically derived quasi-steady model. The pattern of wing kinematics is based on data captured from high-speed video sequences. The forces and moments produced by the wings are modulated by deforming the base wing kinematics along certain characteristic actuation modes. Models of the fly's visual and mechanosensory systems are used to generate inputs to a controller that sets the magnitude of each actuation mode, thus modulating the forces produced by the wings. This simulation framework provides quantitative test-bed for examining the possible control strategies employed by flying insects. Examples demonstrating visual and mechanosensory based pitch rate, velocity, altitude and flight speed control, as well as visually guided flight down a tunnel, are presented.},

abstract = {Insects active in dim light, such as moths and many beetles, normally have superposition compound eyes to increase photon capture. But there are nocturnal and crepuscular insects - such as some species of bees, wasps and butterflies - that have apposition compound eyes. These are likely to have adaptations - including large eye and facet size and coarsened spatial and temporal resolution - that improve their sensitivity and thus their visual reliability. Is this also true for crepuscular insects that are active at intermediate intensities? To test this hypothesis, the visual performance of two closely related butterflies, the diurnal blue morpho Morpho peleides and the crepuscular owl butterfly Caligo memnon, were compared. Compared to the diurnal M. peleides, the crepuscular C. memnon does not appear to be adapted to a nocturnal lifestyle in terms of spatial resolution: the interommatidial angle $\Delta$$\phi$ is similar in both species, and acceptance angles, $\Delta$$\rho$, are only marginally larger in C. memnon. Moreover, temporal resolution is only a little coarser in C. memnon compared to M. peleides. Using a model for sensitivity, we found that the eyes of C. memnon are about four times as light-sensitive as those of M. peleides in the frontal visual field, much of this difference being due to the larger facet diameters found in C. memnon. In summary, greater visual sensitivity has evolved in C. memnon than in M. peleides, showing that adaptations that improve sensitivity can be found not only in nocturnal apposition eyes, but also on a smaller scale in crepuscular apposition eyes.},

Additionally, we made a census of the insect diversity on the studied plant species. Overall we found that insect groups differed greatly in their rate of flower visits (P{\textless}2.2e-16), with bumble bees and honey bees visiting significantly more flowers per time (11.5 and 9.2 flowers/minute, resp.) than the other insect groups. Additionally, we report on a within-group difference in the non-Apidae bees, where the genus Osmia, which is often suggested as an alternative to honey bees as a managed pollinator, was very speedy (13.4 flowers/minute) compared to the other non-Apidae bees (4.3 flowers/minute). Our census showed that the plants attracted a range of insects, with the honey bee as the most abundant visitor (34{\%}). Therefore, rate differences cannot be explained by particular specializations. Lastly, we discuss potential implications of our conclusions for pollination.},

To determine the effects of weather on highbush blueberry, Vaccinium corymbosum L., productivity, we monitored bee activity and compared fruit set, weight, and seed number in a field stocked with honey bees, Apis mellifera L., and common eastern bumble bees, Bombus impatiens (Cresson). Flowers were subjected to one of five treatments during bloom: enclosed, open, open during poor weather only, open during good weather only, or open during poor and good weather. Fewer bees of all types were observed foraging and fewer pollen foragers returned to colonies during poor weather than during good weather. There were also changes in foraging community composition: honey bees dominated during good weather, whereas bumble bees dominated during poor weather. Berries from flowers exposed only during poor weather had higher fruit set in 1 yr and higher berry weight in the other year compared with enclosed clusters. In both years, clusters exposed only during good weather had {\textgreater}5 times as many mature seeds, weighed twice as much, and had double the fruit set of those not exposed. No significant increase over flowers exposed during good weather was observed when clusters were exposed during good and poor weather. Our results are discussed in terms of the role of weather during bloom on the contribution of bees adapted to foraging during cool conditions. {\textcopyright} 2010 Entomological Society of America.},

@article{Serres2017a,
abstract = {Flying insects are able to fly smartly in an unpredictable environment. It has been found that flying insects have smart neurons inside their tiny brains that are sensitive to visual motion also called optic flow. Consequently, flying insects rely mainly on visual motion during their flight maneuvers such as: takeoff or landing, terrain following, tunnel crossing, lateral and frontal obstacle avoidance, and adjusting flight speed in a cluttered environment. Optic flow can be defined as the vector field of the apparent motion of objects, surfaces, and edges in a visual scene generated by the relative motion between an observer (an eye or a camera) and the scene. Translational optic flow is particularly interesting for short-range navigation because it depends on the ratio between (i) the relative linear speed of the visual scene with respect to the observer and (ii) the distance of the observer from obstacles in the surrounding environment without any direct measurement of either speed or distance. In flying insects, roll stabilization reflex and yaw saccades attenuate any rotation at the eye level in roll and yaw respectively (i.e. to cancel any rotational optic flow) in order to ensure pure translational optic flow between two successive saccades. Our survey focuses on feedback-loops which use the translational optic flow that insects employ for collision-free navigation. Optic flow is likely, over the next decade to be one of the most important visual cues that can explain flying insects' behaviors for short-range navigation maneuvers in complex tunnels. Conversely, the biorobotic approach can therefore help to develop innovative flight control systems for flying robots with the aim of mimicking flying insects' abilities and better understanding their flight.},

abstract = {Optical flow-based control strategies have always inspired robotic scientists, especially those in the field of Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs), thanks to their computational efficiency and relative simplicity. A major problem is that the success of optical flow control is governed by the availability of distance estimates, while optical flow provides only the ratio of velocity to distance. Therefore, with only monocular visual information, the inherent nonlinearity of optical flow observables has imposed several challenges in the controller design. In this paper, we propose a newly formulated controller, Extended Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (EINDI), to deal with nonlinearities in the system output, such as optical flow control problems. The proposed method unlocks the potential of its predecessor (INDI) in output feedback control by removing the common assumption of time-scale separation, allowing internal dynamics to exist, and requiring only the input and output measurements. Furthermore, the EINDI method has been implemented on an MAV and tested successfully for optical flow landing in a simulation and a real-world outdoor environment. Both simulation and flight test results show 1) good tracking performance of the EINDI control compared to the conventional feedback control, 2) smooth landing trajectories without any oscillation, and 3) fast adaptation of the EINDI control even for landings at different heights and desired setpoints.},

Values for the forces produced by a fly in level flight were calculated from the measured body angles, using published information from tethered fliers. The drag varied linearly with airspeed. The measured groundspeed of free fliers increased with starvation, not because of the change in weight and thus in the power‐to‐weight ratio, but through behavioural regulation of power output.

abstract = {Frequency response characteristics of bumblebees to vertical visual oscillations were measured and analyzed. We measured the vertical force of the bees at four oscillation frequencies (0.9, 1.8, 3.6 and 7.4 Hz), and summarized their response characteristics in terms of amplitude and phase differences. The amplitude was almost constant throughout the examined frequency domain, whereas the phase gradually lagged with increasing frequency. In order to view the relationship between the input (visual oscillation) and output (response of the bee) more clearly as a control system, we compared them in the same dimension; we calculated hypothetical positions of the tethered bees on the basis of the measured variation in the vertical force, and compared them with the visual stripe positions. The resultant gain and phase data were plotted on a Bode plot. A transfer function was identified from the Bode plot, revealing that the response characteristics of the measured system could be represented as a simple expression. The dynamic control characteristics of the bumblebees were analyzed on the basis of the frequency response data. First, we showed that the measured system possesses a substantial stability margin. This means that the control system has substantial damping characteristics, and was suitable for stable flight control. In addition, our results showed that the measured bumblebee system possesses superior steady state and quick-response characteristics in comparison with a human pilot-vehicle system. Such excellence in both the steady state and transient characteristics (i.e. damping and quick response characteristics) provide the evidence that bumblebees can effectively control their flight with stability and maneuverability.},

abstract = {Most insects are thought to fly by creating a leading-edge vortex that remains attached to the wing as it translates through a stroke. In the species examined so far, stroke amplitude is large, and most of the aerodynamic force is produced halfway through a stroke when translation velocities are highest. Here we demonstrate that honeybees use an alternative strategy, hovering with relatively low stroke amplitude (≈90°) and high wingbeat frequency (≈230 Hz). When measured on a dynamically scaled robot, the kinematics of honeybee wings generate prominent force peaks during the beginning, middle, and end of each stroke, indicating the importance of additional unsteady mechanisms at stroke reversal. When challenged to fly in low-density heliox, bees responded by maintaining nearly constant wingbeat frequency while increasing stroke amplitude by nearly 50{\%}. We examined the aerodynamic consequences of this change in wing motion by using artificial kinematic patterns in which amplitude was systematically increased in 5° increments. To separate the aerodynamic effects of stroke velocity from those due to amplitude, we performed this analysis under both constant frequency and constant velocity conditions. The results indicate that unsteady forces during stroke reversal make a large contribution to net upward force during hovering but play a diminished role as the animal increases stroke amplitude and flight power. We suggest that the peculiar kinematics of bees may reflect either a specialization for increasing load capacity or a physiological limitation of their flight muscles.},

abstract = {Landing behavior is one of the most critical, yet least studied, aspects of insect flight. In order to land safely, an insect must recognize a visual feature, navigate towards it, decelerate, and extend its legs in preparation for touchdown. Although previous studies have focused on the visual stimuli that trigger these different components, the complete sequence has not been systematically studied in a free-flying animal. Using a real-time 3D tracking system in conjunction with high speed digital imaging, we were able to capture the landing sequences of fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) from the moment they first steered toward a visual target, to the point of touchdown. This analysis was made possible by a custom-built feedback system that actively maintained the fly in the focus of the high speed camera. The results suggest that landing is composed of three distinct behavioral modules. First, a fly actively turns towards a stationary target via a directed body saccade. Next, it begins to decelerate at a point determined by both the size of the visual target and its rate of expansion on the retina. Finally, the fly extends its legs when the visual target reaches a threshold retinal size of approximately 60deg. Our data also let us compare landing sequences with flight trajectories that, although initially directed toward a visual target, did not result in landing. In these 'fly-by' trajectories, flies steer toward the target but then exhibit a targeted aversive saccade when the target subtends a retinal size of approximately 33deg. Collectively, the results provide insight into the organization of sensorimotor modules that underlie the landing and search behaviors of insects. {\textcopyright} 2012.

abstract = {The wings of many insects accumulate considerable wear and tear during their lifespan, and this irreversible structural damage can impose significant costs on insect flight performance and survivability. Wing wear in foraging bumblebees (and likely many other species) is caused by inadvertent, repeated collisions with vegetation during flight, suggesting the possibility that insect wings may display biomechanical adaptations to mitigate the damage associated with collisions. We used a novel experimental technique to artificially induce wing wear in bumblebees and yellowjacket wasps, closely related species with similar life histories but distinct wing morphologies. Wasps have a flexible resilin joint (the costal break) positioned distally along the leading edge of the wing, which allows the wing tip to crumple reversibly when it hits an obstacle, whereas bumblebees lack an analogous joint. Through experimental manipulation of its stiffness, we found that the costal break plays a critical role in mitigating collision damage in yellowjacket wings. However, bumblebee wings do not experience as much damage as would be expected based on their lack of a costal break, possibly due to differences in the spatial arrangement of supporting wing veins. Our results indicate that these two species utilize different wing design strategies for mitigating damage resulting from collisions. A simple inertial model of a flapping wing reveals the biomechanical constraints acting on the costal break, which may help explain its absence in bumblebee wings.},

Although linkages between vertebrate movements and ecosystem processes have been established, the effects of mass insect "bioflows" have not been described. We quantified biomass flux over the southern United Kingdom for high-flying ({\textgreater}150 meters) insects and show that {\~{}}3.5 trillion insects (3200 tons of biomass) migrate above the region annually. These flows are not randomly directed in insects larger than 10 milligrams, which exploit seasonally beneficial tailwinds. Large seasonal differences in the southward versus northward transfer of biomass occur in some years, although flows were balanced over the 10-year period. Our long-term study reveals a major transport process with implications for ecosystem services, processes, and biogeochemistry.},

abstract = {In the present paper, the lateral dynamic flight stability properties of two hovering model insects are predicted by an approximate theory based on the averaged model, and computed by numerical simulation that solves the complete equations of motion coupled with the Navier–Stokes equations. Comparison between the theoretical and simulational results provides a test to the validity of the assumptions made in the theory. One of the insects is a model dronefly which has relatively high wingbeat frequency (164 Hz) and the other is a model hawkmoth which has relatively low wingbeat frequency (26 Hz). The following conclusion has been drawn. The theory based on the averaged model works well for the lateral motion of the dronefly. For the hawkmoth, relatively large quantitative differences exist between theory and simulation. This is because the lateral non-dimensional eigenvalues of the hawkmoth are not very small compared with the non-dimensional flapping frequency (the largest lateral non-dimensional eigenvalue is only about 10{\%} smaller than the non-dimensional flapping frequency). Nevertheless, the theory can still correctly predict variational trends of the dynamic properties of the hawkmoth's lateral motion.},

abstract = {Flies achieve supreme flight maneuverability through a small set of miniscule steering mus-cles attached to the wing base. The fast flight maneuvers arise from precisely timed activa-tion of the steering muscles and the resulting subtle modulation of the wing stroke. In addition, slower modulation of wing kinematics arises from changes in the activity of indirect flight muscles in the thorax. We investigated if these modulations can be described as a su-perposition of a limited number of elementary deformations of the wing stroke that are under independent physiological control. Using a high-speed computer vision system, we re-corded the wing motion of tethered flying fruit flies for up to 12 000 consecutive wing strokes at a sampling rate of 6250 Hz. We then decomposed the joint motion pattern of both wings into components that had the minimal mutual information (a measure of statistical depen-dence). In 100 flight segments measured from 10 individual flies, we identified 7 distinct types of frequently occurring least-dependent components, each defining a kinematic pat-tern (a specific deformation of the wing stroke and the sequence of its activation from cycle to cycle). Two of these stroke deformations can be associated with the control of yaw torque and total flight force, respectively. A third deformation involves a change in the downstroke-to-upstroke duration ratio, which is expected to alter the pitch torque. A fourth kinematic pat-tern consists in the alteration of stroke amplitude with a period of 2 wingbeat cycles, extend-ing for dozens of cycles. Our analysis indicates that these four elementary kinematic patterns can be activated mutually independently, and occur both in isolation and in linear superposition. The results strengthen the available evidence for independent control of yaw torque, pitch torque, and total flight force. Our computational method facilitates systematic identification of novel patterns in large kinematic datasets.},

abstract = {Why do animals move the way they do? Bacteria, insects, birds, and fish share with us the necessity to move so as to live. Although each organism follows its own evolutionary course, it also obeys a set of common laws. At the very least, the movement of animals, like that of planets, is governed by Newton's law: All things fall. On Earth, most things fall in air or water, and their motions are thus subject to the laws of hydrodynamics. Through trial and error, animals have found ways to interact with fluid so they can float, drift, swim, sail, glide, soar, and fly. This elementary struggle to escape the fate of falling shapes the development of motors, sensors, and mind. Perhaps we can deduce parts of their neural computations by understanding what animals must do so as not to fall. Here I discuss recent developments along this line of inquiry in the case of insect flight. Asking how often a fly must sense its orientation in order to balance in air has shed new light on the role of motor neurons and steer...},

These methods vary depending on the animal group and the sensory system used by the animal to detect its landing site. In almost all species the use of delayed stall during the landing manoeuvre was observed. Sometimes wing flapping was used to aid in deceleration. With respect to guidance and navigation, most insect, bird and mammal gliders use their vision to guide them to landing via optical flow or motion parallax. Bats, which are nocturnal creatures, rely on their auditory system as they use echolocation to find their nesting site. Some butterfly and moth species guide themselves to landing using their olfactory sense as they follow pheromone trails. The information presented here can be used as a source of information for novel bio-inspired unmanned aircraft design.},

abstract = {Flying insects use the optic flow to navigate safely in unfamiliar environments, especially by adjusting their speed and their clearance from surrounding objects. It has not yet been established, however, which specific parts of the optical flow field insects use to control their speed. With a view to answering this question, freely flying honeybees were trained to fly along a specially designed tunnel including two successive tapering parts: the first part was tapered in the vertical plane and the second one, in the horizontal plane. The honeybees were found to adjust their speed on the basis of the optic flow they perceived not only in the lateral and ventral parts of their visual field, but also in the dorsal part. More specifically, the honeybees' speed varied monotonically, depending on the minimum cross-section of the tunnel, regardless of whether the narrowing occurred in the horizontal or vertical plane. The honeybees' speed decreased or increased whenever the minimum cross-section decreased or increased. In other words, the larger sum of the two opposite optic flows in the horizontal and vertical planes was kept practically constant thanks to the speed control performed by the honeybees upon encountering a narrowing of the tunnel. The previously described ALIS ("AutopiLot using an Insect-based vision System") model nicely matches the present behavioral findings. The ALIS model is based on a feedback control scheme that explains how honeybees may keep their speed proportional to the minimum local cross-section of a tunnel, based solely on optic flow processing, without any need for speedometers or rangefinders. The present behavioral findings suggest how flying insects may succeed in adjusting their speed in their complex foraging environments, while at the same time adjusting their distance not only from lateral and ventral objects but also from those located in their dorsal visual field.},

Here, we explore niche partitioning between bumble and honey bees by comparing a measure of within-patch foraging efficiency, the ratio of flower visitation rate (proportional to energy gain) to body mass (energy cost). This explained a remarkable 74{\%} of the variation in the proportions of bumble to honey bees across 22 plant species and was confirmed using detailed energy calculations. Bumble bees visited flowers at a greater rate (realizing greater energy benefits) than honey bees, but were heavier (incurring greater energy costs) and predominated only on plant species where their benefit : cost ratio was higher than for honey bees. Importantly, the competition between honey bees and bumble bees had no consistent winner, thus highlighting the importance of plant diversity to the coexistence of competing bees. By contrast, tongue : corolla-tube-length ratio explained only 7{\%} of the variation (non-significant). Our results confirm the importance of energetics in understanding community ecology and bee foraging niche and highlight the energetic tightrope navigated by foraging bees, since approximately half the nectar energy gained was expended in its collection.},

abstract = {Moving animals orchestrate myriad motor systems in response to multimodal sensory inputs. Coordinating movement is particularly challenging in flight control, where animals deal with potential instability and multiple degrees of freedom of movement. Prior studies have focused on wings as the primary flight control structures, for which changes in angle of attack or shape are used to modulate lift and drag forces. However, other actuators that may impact flight performance are reflexively activated during flight. We investigated the visual-abdominal reflex displayed by the hawkmoth Manduca sexta to determine its role in flight control. We measured the open-loop stimulus-response characteristics (measured as a transfer function) between the visual stimulus and abdominal response in tethered moths. The transfer function reveals a 41 ms delay and a high-pass filter behavior with a pass band starting at ∼0.5Hz. We also developed a simplified mathematical model of hovering flight wherein articulation of the thoracic-abdominal joint redirects an average lift force provided by the wings. We show that control of the joint, subject to a high-pass filter, is sufficient to maintain stable hovering, but with a slim stability margin. Our experiments and models suggest a novel mechanism by which articulation of the body or 'airframe' of an animal can be used to redirect lift forces for effective flight control. Furthermore, the small stability margin may increase flight agility by easing the transition from stable flight to a more maneuverable, unstable regime. {\textcopyright} 2013.

abstract = {1.A system is described in which a behavioral test is used to match color shades to an arbitrarily chosen level to the compound of brightness and saturation. This system was used with honeybees (Apis mellifera carnica) to develop a series of color marks which were equal to the compound of brightness and color saturation to bees.2.Freely flying honeybees were trained to a blue color mark on a vertical screen. Discrimination of this blue color from violet, green, blue-green and yellow was tested at various natural luminances. In the majority of the experiments the background screen was painted achromatic grey of the same luminosity as the color marks. Two training procedures were used: one utilized a feeding station, the other the hive entrance.3.Bees discriminate colors best at luminances between 101 and 102 cd/m2. Color discrimination is less acute at both higher and lower luminance levels; these deficits at high and low luminances have been termed the bright light and dim light effects, respectively. Color discrimination disappears below 10−1 cd/m2 (Fig. 6). The dependence of color discrimination on available light is the same in both the violet and blue-green regions.4.It is concluded that bees have achromatic vision at low light levels ({\textless}10−1 cd/m2), and that they can use this achromatic vision during extreme low light situations — even during flight orientation. The bright light effect is discussed with respect to results from single unit electrophysiological recording experiments and appears to result from the specific behavior of light adaptation in the retinula cell — monopolar cell system. The narrow luminance band of optimum color discrimination suggests that color discrimination may be better than previously determined using selfruminant spectral lights (von Heiversen 1972a).},

abstract = {Insects are magnificent fliers that are capable of performing many complex tasks such as speed regulation, smooth landings and collision avoidance, even though their computational abilities are limited by their small brain. To investigate how flying insects respond to changes in wind speed and surrounding optic flow, the open-loop sensorimotor response of female Queensland fruit flies (Bactrocera tryoni) was examined. A total of 136 flies were exposed to stimuli comprising sinusoidally varying optic flow and air flow (simulating forward movement) under tethered conditions in a virtual reality arena. Two responses were measured: the thrust and the abdomen pitch. The dynamics of the responses to optic flow and air flow were measured at various frequencies, and modelled as a multicompartment linear system, which accurately captured the behavioural responses of the fruit flies. The results indicate that these two behavioural responses are concurrently sensitive to changes of optic flow as well as wind. The abdomen pitch showed a streamlining response, where the abdomen was raised higher as the magnitude of either stimulus was increased. The thrust, in contrast, exhibited a counter-phase response where maximum thrust occurred when the optic flow or wind flow was at a minimum, indicating that the flies were attempting to maintain an ideal flight speed. When the changes in the wind and optic flow were in phase (i.e. did not contradict each other), the net responses (thrust and abdomen pitch) were well approximated by an equally weighted sum of the responses to the individual stimuli. However, when the optic flow and wind stimuli were presented in counterphase, the flies seemed to respond to only one stimulus or the other, demonstrating a form of 'selective attention'.},

abstract = {1. In social insects, reproductive success and survival of the colony critically depend on the colony's ability to efficiently allocate workers to the various tasks which need to be performed. In bumblebees, workers show a large variation of body size within a colony. Large workers tend to leave the nest and forage for nectar and pollen, whereas small workers stay inside the nest and fulfill nest duties. It was speculated that size-related differences of the sensory system might contribute to alloethism found in bumblebee colonies. 2. In the first part, we investigated how body size determines eye morphology. We measured several eye parameters of Bombus terrestris workers and drones. In both, workers and drones, larger individuals had larger eyes with larger facet diameters, more ommatidia and larger ocelli. At similar body size, drones exhibited larger eyes and ocelli compared to workers. Due to theoretical considerations, we predict that large individuals with large eyes should be better able to operate in illumination conditions of lower intensity than small individuals, since ommatidial sensitivity is proportional to the square of facet diameter. 3. In the second part, we tested this prediction. In a behavioural experiment, we first caught bumblebees of various sizes in the field and then determined the lowest light intensity level at which they are just able to fly under controlled laboratory conditions. We tested workers of B. terrestris and B. pascuorum, and workers and drones of B. lapidarius. Large bumblebees were able to fly under lower light levels compared to small bees, with light intensity thresholds ranging from 1{\textperiodcentered}1 to 5{\textperiodcentered}5 lux. 4. Our results indicate that the increased light sensitivity of the visual system of large bumblebees allows them to fly under poor light conditions, for example, very early in the morning or late at dusk. This is of potential benefit to the survival of a bumblebee colony since flowers that open early in the morning usually have accumulated a relatively high amount of nectar and pollen throughout the night, and large bumblebees can utilize these resources earlier than most other bees. Thus, our findings have important implications for the understanding of the functional significance and evolution of alloethism in bumblebee colonies.},

abstract = {Flying insects employ elegant optical-flow-based strategies to solve complex tasks such as landing or obstacle avoidance. Roboticists have mimicked these strategies on flying robots with only limited success, because optical flow (1) cannot disentangle distance from velocity and (2) is less informative in the highly important flight direction. Here, we propose a solution to these fundamental shortcomings by having robots learn to estimate distances to objects by their visual appearance. The learning process obtains supervised targets from a stability-based distance estimation approach. We have successfully implemented the process on a small flying robot. For the task of landing, it results in faster, smooth landings. For the task of obstacle avoidance, it results in higher success rates at higher flight speeds. Our results yield improved robotic visual navigation capabilities and lead to a novel hypothesis on insect intelligence: behaviours that were described as optical-flow-based and hardwired actually benefit from learning processes.},

abstract = {Control theory arose from a need to control synthetic systems. From regulating steam engines to tuning radios to devices capable of autonomous movement, it provided a formal mathematical basis for understanding the role of feedback in the stability (or change) of dynamical systems. It provides a framework for understanding any system with regulation via feedback, including biological ones such as regulatory gene networks, cellular metabolic systems, sensorimotor dynamics of moving animals, and even ecological or evolutionary dynamics of organisms and populations. Here, we focus on four case studies of the sensorimotor dynamics of animals, each of which involves the application of principles from control theory to probe stability and feedback in an organism's response to perturbations. We use examples from aquatic (two behaviors performed by electric fish), terrestrial (following of walls by cockroaches), and aerial environments (flight control by moths) to highlight how one can use control theory to understand the way feedback mechanisms interact with the physical dynamics of animals to determine their stability and response to sensory inputs and perturbations. Each case study is cast as a control problem with sensory input, neural processing, and motor dynamics, the output of which feeds back to the sensory inputs. Collectively, the interaction of these systems in a closed loop determines the behavior of the entire system.},

abstract = {Here we consider how new experimental approaches in biomechanics can be used to attain a systems-level understanding of the dynamics of animal flight control. Our aim in this paper is not to provide detailed results and analysis, but rather to tackle several conceptual and methodological issues that have stood in the way of experimentalists in achieving this goal, and to offer tools for overcoming these. We begin by discussing the interplay between analytical and empirical methods, emphasizing that the structure of the models we use to analyse flight control dictates the empirical measurements we must make in order to parameterize them. We then provide a conceptual overview of tethered-flight paradigms, comparing classical. open-loop' and. 'closed-loop' setups, and describe a flight simulator that we have recently developed for making flight dynamics measurements on tethered insects. Next, we provide a conceptual overview of free-flight paradigms, focusing on the need to use system identification techniques in order to analyse the data they provide, and describe two new techniques that we have developed for making flight dynamics measurements on freely flying birds. First, we describe a technique for obtaining inertial measurements of the orientation, angular velocity and acceleration of a steppe eagle Aquila nipalensis in wide-ranging free flight, together with synchronized measurements of wing and tail kinematics using onboard instrumentation and video cameras. Second, we describe a photogrammetric method to measure the 3D wing kinematics of the eagle during take-off and landing. In each case, we provide demonstration data to illustrate the kinds of information available from each method. We conclude by discussing the prospects for systems-level analyses of flight control using these techniques and others like them.},

abstract = {Films of pigeons flying to a perch were analysed to test a theory of how speed of approach and timing of foot extension in preparation for landing are visually controlled. Rapid neural computation of distance to perch and of speed and deceleration would seem to be required. However, according to the theory, none of this is necessary. Simpler control is possible based solely on the value of the tau function of certain optic variables x, where the tau function of {\{}$\backslash$texttimes{\}} is {\{}$\backslash$texttimes{\}} divided by its rate of change; i.e. tau(x)=x/x˙˙ tau(x) is a first-order approximation of time to contact with the perch and so could be used for timing foot extension. Controlled braking is possible by simply keeping tau(x), the rate of change of tau(x), constant. The results indicated that pigeons did regulate their braking when approaching the perch by keeping tau(x) constant and initiated foot extension when tau(x) reached a threshold value of approximately 150 ms. They followed this procedure even when they had one eye covered, and so binocular vision was not necessary for regulating braking or timing foot extension. It is shown that an optic variable that the pigeons could be using is the width of the optic projection of the gap between foot and perch. It is further shown that they could be using the same optic variable for controlling the trajectory of their feet to contact the perch.},

abstract = {Bees, the largest ({\textgreater}16,000 species) and most important radiation of pollinating insects, originated in early to mid-Cretaceous, roughly in synchrony with the angiosperms (flowering plants). Understanding the diversification of the bees and the coevolutionary history of bees and angiosperms requires a well supported phylogeny of bees (as well as angiosperms). We reconstructed a robust phylogeny of bees at the family and subfamily levels using a data set of five genes (4,299 nucleotide sites) plus morphology (109 characters). The molecular data set included protein coding (elongation factor-1$\alpha$, RNA polymerase II, and LW rhodopsin), as well as ribosomal (28S and 18S) nuclear gene data. Analyses of both the DNA data set and the DNA+morphology data set by parsimony and Bayesian methods yielded a single well supported family-level tree topology that places Melittidae as a paraphyletic group at the base of the phylogeny of bees. This topology (“Melittidae-LT basal”) is significantly better than a previously proposed alternative topology (“Colletidae basal”) based both on likelihood and Bayesian methods. Our results have important implications for understanding the early diversification, historical biogeography, host–plant evolution, and fossil record of bees. The earliest branches of bee phylogeny include lineages that are predominantly host–plant specialists, suggesting that host–plant specificity is an ancestral trait in bees. Our results suggest an African origin for bees, because the earliest branches of the tree include predominantly African lineages. These results also help explain the predominance of Melittidae, Apidae, and Megachilidae among the earliest fossil bees.},

@article{Muijres2017,
abstract = {To escape after taking a blood meal, a mosquito must exert forces sufficiently high to take off when carrying a load roughly equal to its body weight, while simultaneously avoiding detection by minimizing tactile signals exerted on the host's skin. We studied this trade-off between escape speed and stealth in the malaria mosquito Anopheles coluzzii using 3D motion analysis of high-speed stereoscopic videos of mosquito take-offs and aerodynamic modeling. We found that during the push-off phase, mosquitoes enhanced take-off speed using aerodynamic forces generated by the beating wings in addition to leg-based push-off forces, whereby wing forces contributed 61{\%} of the total push-off force. Exchanging leg-derived push-off forces for wing-derived aerodynamic forces allows the animal to reduce peak force production on the host's skin. By slowly extending their long legs throughout the push-off, mosquitoes spread push-off forces over a longer time window than insects with short legs, thereby further reducing peak leg forces. Using this specialized take-off behavior, mosquitoes are capable of reaching take-off speeds comparable to those of similarly sized fruit flies, but with weight-normalized peak leg forces that were only 27{\%} of those of the fruit flies. By limiting peak leg forces, mosquitoes possibly reduce the chance of being detected by the host. The resulting combination of high take-off speed and low tactile signals on the host might help increase the mosquito's success in escaping from blood-hosts, which consequently also increases the chance of transmitting vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, to future hosts.},

Although vision-mediated flight is considered a key factor for understanding navigation and guidance, there is a continuing debate about the exact role of the insect's compound eye for stability and maneuverability. This chapter focuses on visual motion detection in flies, highlighting the way in which these insects cope with pertur bations of their visual environment. Numerical models are used to predict the precision of the fly's motor system required for heading stability from the dynamic properties of the sensory organs. Such information allows a better understanding of sensorimotor control strategies in flying insects, and is also of interest for engineers aiming to improve the performance of future generation biomimetic micro air vehicles based on nature-inspired control algorithms.},

abstract = {In this study, the daily and seasonal influences of abiotic factors and the amount of floral resources on the foraging frequency of bees were determined. The experiments were performed, during 12 consecutive months, in the main floral sources used by bees in a secondary forest fragment. The foraging frequency of each bee species on flowers of each plant was recorded for 20-min periods, every hour. To verify whether the foraging activity is influenced by abiotic factors, Pearson's correlation analysis and linear regression tests were performed for the dominant bee species. Temperature and luminosity were the two main abiotic factors regulating foraging activities of bees. A positive correlation was found between the foraging frequency of most bees and these two variables. Conversely, the foraging activity was influenced neither by the relative humidity nor by the wind speed. The activity of each species depends on a combination of factors that include not only abiotic variables, but also the amount of floral resources available during the day, body size, and behavior of each visitor. After a certain period of the day, the scarcity of floral resources produced by most plants can stimulate the bees to forage in the flowers early in subsequent days, which may occur before the period in which the abiotic conditions are really favorable.},

@article{Laughlin1982,
abstract = {1. In locust photoreceptors, the amplitude of the response to light pulses lasting less than 20 ms depends solely upon the number of absorbed photons, which can be estimated at low intensities by counting quantum bumps. Consequently, each receptor can be operated as a calibrated photon counter. 2. Three types of noise in receptor responses have been identified‐‐extrinsic or photon noise and two types of intrinsic noise, dark noise (spontaneous activity) and transducer noise (noise in the transduction mechanism). The methods by which the noise sources are measured and identified involves measuring the responses to a train of flashes of constant intensity and converting these voltage values into a series of equivalent quantum catches. Because photon absorptions follow the Poisson distribution, the variance among equivalent catches due to photon noise equals the mean catch, and any excess variance represents intrinsic noise. 3. Dark noise is negligible: spontaneous signals (quantum bumps produced in darkness) occur less than ten times per hour at 25 degrees C, and the combined effects of membrane and electrode noise are unimportant at all but the highest intensities. 4. At low intensities transducer noise is responsible for more than 50{\%} of all receptor noise (variance), and this rises to 90{\%} when bright stimuli are presented to the dark‐adapted eye. 5. Two simple models of transduction indicate that variations in the amplitudes and latencies of responses to single photons are a major source of transducer noise. 6. Transducer noise would be difficult to detect from an analysis of response noise alone, without knowledge of absolute photon catch, because in some important respects it mimics photon noise, e.g. it lowers the quantum efficiency without violating the square root relationship relating increment thresholds to mean intensity. {\textcopyright} 1982 The Physiological Society},

abstract = {More than a million insects and approximately 11,000 vertebrates utilize flapping wings to fly. However, flapping flight has only been studied in a few of these species, so many challenges remain in understanding this form of locomotion. Five key aerodynamic mechanisms have been identified for insect flight. Among these is the leading edge vortex, which is a convergent solution to avoid stall for insects, bats and birds. The roles of the other mechanisms - added mass, clap and fling, rotational circulation and wing-wake interactions - have not yet been thoroughly studied in the context of vertebrate flight. Further challenges to understanding bat and bird flight are posed by the complex, dynamic wing morphologies of these species and the more turbulent airflow generated by their wings compared with that observed during insect flight. Nevertheless, three dimensionless numbers that combine key flow, morphological and kinematic parameters - the Reynolds number, Rossby number and advance ratio - govern flapping wing aerodynamics for both insects and vertebrates. These numbers can thus be used to organize an integrative framework for studying and comparing animal flapping flight. Here, we provide a roadmap for developing such a framework, highlighting the aerodynamic mechanisms that remain to be quantified and compared across species. Ultimately, incorporating complex flight maneuvers, environmental effects and developmental stages into this framework will also be essential to advancing our understanding of the biomechanics, movement ecology and evolution of animal flight.},

abstract = {In closed-loop systems, sensor feedback delays may have disastrous implications for performance and stability. Flies have evolved multiple specializations to reduce this latency, but the fastest feedback during flight involves a delay that is still significant on the timescale of body dynamics. We explored the effect of sensor delay on flight stability and performance for yaw turns using a dynamically scaled robotic model of the fruitfly, Drosophila. The robot was equipped with a real-time feedback system that performed active turns in response to measured torque about the functional yaw axis. We performed system response experiments for a proportional controller in yaw velocity for a range of feedback delays, similar in dimensionless timescale to those experienced by a fly. The results show a fundamental trade-off between sensor delay and permissible feedback gain, and suggest that fast mechanosensory feedback in flies, and most probably in other insects, provide a source of active damping which compliments that contributed by passive effects. Presented in the context of these findings, a control architecture whereby a haltere-mediated inner-loop proportional controller provides damping for slower visually mediated feedback is consistent with tethered-flight measurements, free-flight observations and engineering design principles. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Flight control in insects depends on self-induced image motion (optic flow), which the visual system must process to generate appropriate corrective steering maneuvers. Classic experiments in tethered insects applied rigorous system identification techniques for the analysis of turning reactions in the presence of rotating pattern stimuli delivered in open-loop. However, the functional relevance of these measurements for visual free-flight control remains equivocal due to the largely unknown effects of the highly constrained experimental conditions. To perform a systems analysis of the visual flight speed response under free-flight conditions, we implemented a 'one-parameter open-loop' paradigm using 'TrackFly' in a wind tunnel equipped with real-time tracking and virtual reality display technology. Upwind flying flies were stimulated with sine gratings of varying temporal and spatial frequencies, and the resulting speed responses were measured from the resulting flight speed reactions. To control flight speed, the visual system of the fruit fly extracts linear pattern velocity robustly over a broad range of spatio-temporal frequencies. The speed signal is used for a proportional control of flight speed within locomotor limits. The extraction of pattern velocity over a broad spatio-temporal frequency range may require more sophisticated motion processing mechanisms than those identified in flies so far. In Drosophila, the neuromotor pathways underlying flight speed control may be suitably explored by applying advanced genetic techniques, for which our data can serve as a baseline. Finally, the high-level control principles identified in the fly can be meaningfully transferred into a robotic context, such as for the robust and efficient control of autonomous flying micro air vehicles.},

abstract = {In recent decades, the views on the mechanics of long-range migrations of insects have diverged into two main lines: (1) French and White (1960), Shaw (1962), Hurst (1963, 1964), and Mikkola and Salmensuu (1965), working on Lepidoptera presumed downwind direction of migrations and analysed their data with the aid of wind trajectories which describe atmospheric tracks of air particles. Rainey (1963) showed that the displacement of locust swarms is predominantly downwind. A general theory was formulated on these lines by Kennedy (1961). (2) Baker (1978), however, has suggested that during migrations insects mainly use compass orientation. Thus, two controversial doctrines have been proposed. Nevertheless, it seems that even an individual species may use different migration and orientation mechanisms under different situations. In addition, regular and definite upwind migrations have been shown to occur in wasps and bumble bees (Mikkola 1978). The intention of this article is to document data on the role of wind as a factor affecting the direction of insect migrations. Examples come from the published and unpublished data gathered by the author in Finland and from the literature.},

abstract = {Insects are magnificent fliers that are capable of performing many complex tasks such as speed regulation, smooth landings and collision avoidance, even though their computational abilities are limited by their small brain. To investigate how flying insects respond to changes in wind speed and surrounding optic flow, the open-loop sensorimotor response of female Queensland fruit flies (Bactrocera tryoni) was examined. A total of 136 flies were exposed to stimuli comprising sinusoidally varying optic flow and air flow (simulating forward movement) under tethered conditions in a virtual reality arena. Two responses were measured: the thrust and the abdomen pitch. The dynamics of the responses to optic flow and air flow were measured at various frequencies, and modelled as a multicompartment linear system, which accurately captured the behavioural responses of the fruit flies. The results indicate that these two behavioural responses are concurrently sensitive to changes of optic flow as well as wind. The abdomen pitch showed a streamlining response, where the abdomen was raised higher as the magnitude of either stimulus was increased. The thrust, in contrast, exhibited a counter-phase response where maximum thrust occurred when the optic flow or wind flow was at a minimum, indicating that the flies were attempting to maintain an ideal flight speed. When the changes in the wind and optic flow were in phase (i.e. did not contradict each other), the net responses (thrust and abdomen pitch) were well approximated by an equally weighted sum of the responses to the individual stimuli. However, when the optic flow and wind stimuli were presented in counterphase, the flies seemed to respond to only one stimulus or the other, demonstrating a form of 'selective attention'.},

Insects can produce more force by increasing stroke amplitude and/or flapping frequency, but the kinematic response of a given species is thought to be consistent. We examined bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) carrying both light and heavy loads and found that stroke amplitude increased in proportion to load size, but did not predict metabolic rate. Rather, metabolic rate was strongly tied to frequency, which was determined not by load size but by the bee's average loading state and loading history, with heavily loaded bees displaying smaller changes in frequency and smaller increases in metabolic rate to support additional loading. This implies that bees can increase force production through alternative mechanisms; yet, they often choose the energetically costly option of elevating frequency, suggesting associated performance benefits that merit further investigation.},

abstract = {Wind is a critical factor in the ecology of pollinating insects such as bees. However, the role of wind in determining patterns of bee abundance and floral visitation rates across space and time is not well understood. Orchid bees are an important and diverse group of neotropical pollinators that harvest pollen, nectar and resin from plants. In addition, male orchid bees collect volatile scents that they store in special chambers in their hind legs, and for which the wind-based dispersal of odours may play a particularly crucial role. Here, we take advantage of this specialized scent foraging behaviour to study the effects of wind on orchid bee visitation at scent sources in a fragmented tropical forest ecosystem. Consistent with previous work, forest cover increased orchid bee visitation. In addition, we find that temporal changes in wind speed and turbulence increase visitation to scent stations within sites. These results suggest that the increased dispersal of attractive scents provided by wind and turbulence outweighs any biomechanical or energetic costs that might deter bees from foraging in these conditions. Overall, our results highlight the significance of wind in the ecology of these important pollinators in neotropical forests.},

abstract = {Over the last half century, work with flies, bees, and moths have revealed a number of visual guidance strategies for controlling different aspects of flight. Some algorithms, such as the use of pattern velocity in forward flight, are employed by all insects studied so far, and are used to control multiple flight tasks such as regulation of speed, measurement of distance, and positioning through narrow passages. Although much attention has been devoted to long-range navigation and homing in birds, until recently, very little was known about how birds control flight in a moment-to-moment fashion. A bird that flies rapidly through dense foliage to land on a branch-as birds often do-engages in a veritable three-dimensional slalom, in which it has to continually dodge branches and leaves, and find, and possibly even plan a collision-free path to the goal in real time. Each mode of flight from take-offto goal could potentially involve a different visual guidance algorithm. Here, we briefly review strategies for visual guidance of flight in insects, synthesize recent work from short-range visual guidance in birds, and offer a general comparison between the two groups of organisms.},

abstract = {The impressive repertoire of honeybee visually guided behaviors, and their ability to learn has made them an important tool for elucidating the visual basis of behavior. Like other insects, bees perform optomotor course correction to optic flow, a response that is dependent on the spatial structure of the visual environment. However, bees can also distinguish the speed of image motion during forward flight and landing, as well as estimate flight distances (odometry), irrespective of the visual scene. The neural pathways underlying these abilities are unknown. Here we report on a cluster of descending neurons (DNIIIs) that are shown to have the directional tuning properties necessary for detecting image motion during forward flight and landing on vertical surfaces. They have stable firing rates during prolonged periods of stimulation and respond to a wide range of image speeds, making them suitable to detect image flow during flight behaviors. While their responses are not strictly speed tuned, the shape and amplitudes of their speed tuning functions are resistant to large changes in spatial frequency. These cells are prime candidates not only for the control of flight speed and landing, but also the basis of a neural 'front end' of the honeybee's visual odometer.},

@phdthesis{Tichit2021,
abstract = {The buzzing flight of bees is a popular summer hit. Yet, outside of a few familiar species of honeybees and bumblebees, these fantastic little creatures are still mostly unknown. With about twenty-five thousand species, bees are a very diverse group. They can be found in drastically different habitats. For example, some kinds of bumblebees endure the freezing temperatures and windswept tundra of Greenland, while others only thrive in the heat and humidity of the Amazonian forest. Some bees live in huge colonies with tens of thousands of members, while others live solitary lives. Some are narrower than a sesame seed, while others can reach the size of a human thumb. Despite these differences, bees all have in common the urge to visit flowers where they find their food. This habit makes them very important for the pollination of plants across the world. To go about their laborious life, bees make extensive use of their vision. They possess two types of eyes - ocelli and compound eyes - that they use to control their flight, find their way through the world, discover flowers and spot possible mates. To understand how bees interact with the environment, we thus need to explore the diversity of their eyes and of how they use them.The first chapter of my thesis is about landing, which is a fundamental behaviour in flying insects. However, in bees it is poorly known whether different species land in different ways. During an expedition to Brazil, I came across a species of bee with the most peculiar landing style. Rather than slowing down to land, as most animals do, these bees accelerate just before touchdown on the entrance to their hive. Why do these bees speed up when they land? Using a computer simulation, I found that this weird strategy may help the bees to avoid mid-air collisions with nestmates and reduce bee 'traffic jams' in front of the hive. In turn, this would make food collection more efficient for the colony and it would be easier for hive members to defend against intruders. With this chapter, I showed that the lifestyle of bees - where they live, how many there are and if they are exposed to intruders - can strongly influence their behaviour.In chapter two, I then asked if and how the bees from chapter one use vision to control their peculiar landing. I found that they did indeed rely on vision to control their landing and that they did so in a simple manner. Essentially, when the image of the entrance of the hive reaches a given size on their eyes, these bees start to speed up. When the image of the entrance reaches a second set size on the eyes of landing bees, they extend their landing gear - which is, for bees, their legs - in preparation for touchdown. This chapter reveals that bees can use simple rules to achieve complex behaviours such as landing safely.To explore the diversity of eyes in a large number of bees, we use X-ray images taken from a sample as it rotates (an approach known as computed tomography or CT, commonly used in a medical setting) to produce 3D images of the eyes. However, powerful tools are needed to analyse the large amounts of data that this approach generates. As I want to better understand how bee eyes work, I needed an efficient method for analysing 3D eye images created by CT, so I developed an automatic tool for distinguishing essential optical structures in the eyes of insects and other arthropods. In chapter three, I describe this method, provide a guide to use it, and give examples of its application to a few insect eyes.In the last chapter, I used CT to look into the diversity of the eyes across a range of bumblebees from different habitats around the world. Even though different species are genetically close to each other, I found that their eyes were far from 'all the same'. For example, bumblebees that live in forests have eyes that may enable them to see less sharp but better in dim light than bumblebees living in open landscapes. I also found that cuckoo bumblebees - bees that lay their eggs in another bumblebee hive like cuckoo birds do - had peculiar eyes in comparison to other bumblebees. This indicates that the eyes of each species of bumblebees may be specialised for a specific combination of lifestyle and habitat. These results are important for the conservation of bumblebees because they suggest that the eyes of some species may make them more sensitive than others to changes in the environment. For example, farming practices that create large open fields may particularly disadvantage bumblebees with eyes adapted to forests.These four chapters only scratch the surface of the tight links between the eyes of bees, the ways they behave, and the worlds they live in. I hope that efforts to look into their diverse eyes will continue and will help to protect these crucial but endangered animals.

Detta kan i sin tur f{\"{o}}rb{\"{a}}ttra kolonins kapacitet att samla f{\"{o}}da och f{\"{o}}rsvara boet mot inkr{\"{a}}ktare.

I dessa studier uppt{\"{a}}ckte jag att bina b{\"{o}}rjar accelerera n{\"{a}}r bilden p{\aa} boets ing{\aa}ng n{\aa}r en specifik storlek i deras {\"{o}}gon. S{\aa} snart bilden p{\aa} boets ing{\aa}ng n{\aa}r en annan given storlek f{\"{a}}ller de snabbt ut sitt landningsst{\"{a}}ll, dvs sina ben, f{\"{o}}r att slutligen landa. Resultaten visar tydligt hur bin kan f{\"{o}}lja mycket enkla regler f{\"{o}}r att styra komplicerade och viktiga beteende. Jag och m{\aa}nga andra forskare anv{\"{a}}nder idag r{\"{o}}ntgen som str{\aa}las p{\aa} ett roterande prov f{\"{o}}r att producera en 3D-bild av det samma (detta {\"{a}}r en teknik som kallas r{\"{o}}ntgentomografi och har l{\"{a}}nge anv{\"{a}}nts f{\"{o}}r diagnostik inom v{\aa}rden). Problemet {\"{a}}r att det kr{\"{a}}vs effektiva algoritmer f{\"{o}}r att kunna analysera den enorma m{\"{a}}ngd data som denna teknik genererar. Inom ramarna f{\"{o}}r att f{\"{o}}rst{\aa} hur {\"{o}}gonen hos bin {\"{a}}r uppbyggda, utvecklade jag en snabb metod f{\"{o}}r att m{\"{o}}jligg{\"{o}}ra en 3D- analys av r{\"{o}}ntgentomografiska bilder av denna typ av sm{\aa}, biologiska prov. I avhandlingens tredje kapitel beskriver jag det verktyg jag utvecklat f{\"{o}}r att automatiskt identifiera viktiga optiska komponenter hos ett insekts{\"{o}}ga. I avhandlingens sista kapitlen presenterar jag hur r{\"{o}}ntgentomografi kan anv{\"{a}}ndas f{\"{o}}r att utforska m{\aa}ngfalden i {\"{o}}gonegenskap hos humlor som bor i olika milj{\"{o}}er. {\"{A}}ven om m{\aa}nga av dessa arter var mycket n{\"{a}}ra sl{\"{a}}kt, kunde jag utifr{\aa}n dessa 3D-studier visa att deras {\"{o}}gon skilde sig {\aa}t i flera aspekter. Till exempel humlor som lever i skogar har {\"{o}}gon som troligen g{\"{o}}r att de ser suddigare - men b{\"{a}}ttre i m{\"{o}}rker - {\"{a}}n humlor fr{\aa}n {\"{o}}ppna landskap.

Sammantaget pekar min studie mot att {\"{o}}gonen hos var humlaart {\"{a}}r n{\"{a}}ra anpassad till en given kombination av livsstil och milj{\"{o}}. Detta tyder in sin tur p{\aa} att vissa arter, utifr{\aa}n hur deras {\"{o}}gon {\"{a}}r uppbyggda, {\"{a}}r k{\"{a}}nsligare inf{\"{o}}r snabba omv{\"{a}}rlds-f{\"{o}}r{\"{a}}ndringar {\"{a}}n andra.

abstract = {1. Bees exemplify flights under bright sunlight. A few species across bee families have evolved nocturnality, displaying remarkable adaptations to overcome limitations of their daylight-suited apposition eyes. Phase inversion to nocturnality in a minority of bees that co-exist with diurnal bees provide a unique opportunity to study ecological benefits that mediate total temporal niche shifts. While floral traits and sensory modalities associated with the evolution of classical nocturnal pollination syndromes, e.g. by bats and moths, are well-studied, nocturnality in bees represent a poorly understood, recently invaded, extreme niche. 2. To test the competitive release hypothesis, we examine how nocturnality shapes foraging by comparing pollen loads, nest pollen and flower visitation of sympatric nocturnal and diurnal carpenter bees. We predicted that nocturnal bees primarily use night-blooming flowers, show little/no resource overlap with diurnal species and competitive release favours night-time pollen collection for provisioning. 3. Contrarily, we found substantial resource overlap between nocturnal and diurnal bees. Flower opening times, floral longevity and plant abundance did not define nocturnal flower use. Smaller pollen loads on nocturnal foragers suggests subsistence on resource leftovers largely from diurnal flowers. Greater pollen types/diversity on nocturnal foragers indicates lower floral constancy compared to diurnal congenerics. Reduced activity during new moon compared to full moon suggests constraints to nocturnal foraging. 4. Invasion and sustenance within the nocturnal niche is characterised by: i)opportunistic foraging on residual resources as indicated by smaller pollen loads, extensive utilisation of day-blooming flowers and substantial overlap with diurnal bees, ii)generalisation at two levels – between and within foraging trips as indicated by lower floral constancy, iii)reduced foraging on darker nights, indicating visual constraints despite sensitive optics. This together with smaller populations and univoltine breeding in nocturnal compared to multivoltine diurnal counterparts, suggest that nocturnality imposes substantial fitness costs. 5. In conclusion, the evolution of nocturnality in bees is accompanied by resource generalisation instead of specialisation. Reduced floral constancy suggests differences in foraging strategies of nocturnal and diurnal bees which merits further investigation. The relative roles of competition, floral rewards and predators should be examined to fully understand the evolution and maintenance of nocturnality in bees.},

abstract = {The spectacular success and diversification of insects rests critically on two major evolutionary adaptations. First, the evolution of flight, which enhanced the ability of insects to colonize novel ecological habitats, evade predators, or hunt prey; and second, the miniaturization of their body size, which profoundly influenced all aspects of their biology from development to behavior. However, miniaturization imposes steep demands on the flight system because smaller insects must flap their wings at higher frequencies to generate sufficient aerodynamic forces to stay aloft; it also poses challenges to the sensorimotor system because precise control of wing kinematics and body trajectories requires fast sensory feedback. These tradeoffs are best studied in Dipteran flies in which rapid mechanosensory feedback to wing motor system is provided by halteres, reduced hind wings that evolved into gyroscopic sensors. Halteres oscillate at the same frequency as and precisely antiphase to the wings; they detect body rotations during flight, thus providing feedback that is essential for controlling wing motion during aerial maneuvers. Although tight phase synchrony between halteres and wings is essential for providing proper timing cues, the mechanisms underlying this coordination are not well understood. Here, we identify specific mechanical linkages within the thorax that passively mediate both wing-wing and wing-haltere phase synchronization. We demonstrate that the wing hinge must possess a clutch system that enables flies to independently engage or disengage each wing from the mechanically linked thorax. In concert with a previously described gearbox located within the wing hinge, the clutch system enables independent control of each wing. These biomechanical features are essential for flight control in flies.},

abstract = {Flying insects execute aerial maneuvers through subtle manipulations of their wing motions. Here, we measure the free-flight kinematics of fruit flies and determine how they modulate their wing pitching to induce sharp turns. By analyzing the torques these insects exert to pitch their wings, we infer that the wing hinge acts as a torsional spring that passively resists the wing's tendency to flip in response to aerodynamic and inertial forces. To turn, the insects asymmetrically change the spring rest angles to generate asymmetric rowing motions of their wings. Thus, insects can generate these maneuvers using only a slight active actuation that biases their wing motion. {\textcopyright} 2010 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Conical cells in the petal epidermis are common across many diverse flowering plant species, and it was recently shown that in difficult-to-handle flowers, pollinators prefer conical cells because they increase grip. However, this does not explain the prevalence of conical cells amongst other, simpler, flowers. 2.The movement of objects is an integral part of the world and is of particular importance to bees because the relative motion of objects is essential to a bee's 3D vision. The motion of flowers can increase pollinator attraction; however, it also makes flowers more difficult for a bee to handle. This makes foraging more metabolically expensive. To explore whether conical petal cells make handling moving flowers easier, we tested bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) preference for conical- or flat-celled Petunia (Petunia hybrida) flowers under different conditions of motion. We also used differently coloured Petunia flowers to test how colour and visibility interact with tactile cues to form a pollinator's preferences. 3.Bees preferred to visit conical-celled Petunia flowers except when the conical-celled flowers were harder to detect visually. The bees then favoured flowers that were easier to detect. But when flowers were moving and more difficult to handle, bees always learned to favour conical-celled flowers, irrespective of visual difficulty. 4.By providing easier handling through better grip from conical cells, the plant can benefit from the natural visual attractant of flowers moving in the wind without losing pollinator preference for easier-to-handle flowers. Bee preference for conical-celled flowers when flowers are moving shows how plants can use conical petal cells to take advantage of an attractant that would otherwise decrease pollinator preference by making handling difficult (movement). The selective pressure from pollinators choosing conical-celled flowers when flowers are moving in the wind provides an explanation for the persistence of conical cells in so many diverse angiosperm species across evolutionary time. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.

The aerodynamics model is considered as forcing upon rigid body dynamics, and frequency-based system identification tools used to derive the models. The analysis indicates two stable real poles, and two very lightly damped and nearly unstable complex poles describing a decoupling of roll/sideslip oscillatory motion from a first order subsidence yaw behavior.

Stabilization control must have been applied. In this study, we investigate the longitudinal stabilization control of the bumblebee. The method of computational fluid dynamics is used to compute the control derivatives and the techniques of eigenvalue and eigenvector analysis and modal decomposition are used for solving the equations of motion. Controllability analysis shows that at all flight speeds considered, although inherently unstable, the flight is controllable. By feedbacking the state variables, i.e. vertical and horizontal velocities, pitching rate and pitch angle (which can be measured by the sensory system of the insect), to produce changes in stroke angle and angle of attack of the wings, the flight can be stabilized, explaining why the bumblebees can fly stably even if they are passively unstable.},

Honeybees followed the stationary part of the floor at a given height. On encountering the moving part of the floor, which moved in the same direction as their flight, honeybees descended and flew at a lower height, thus gradually restoring their ventral optic flow (OF) to a similar value to that they had percieved when flying over the stationary part of the floor. This was therefore achieved not by increasing their airspeed, but by lowering their height of flight. These results can be accounted for by a control system called an optic flow regulator, as proposed in previous studies. This visuo-motor control scheme explains how honeybees can navigate safely along tunnels on the sole basis of OF measurements, without any need to measure either their speed or the clearance from the surrounding walls.},

abstract = {Most insect migrants fly at considerable altitudes (hundreds of meters above the  ground) where they utilize fast-flowing winds to achieve rapid and comparatively long-distance transport. The nocturnal aerial migrant fauna has been well studied with entomological radars, and many studies have demonstrated that flight orientations are frequently grouped around a common direction in a range of nocturnal insect migrants. Common orientation typically occurs close to the downwind direction (thus ensuring that a large component of the insects' self-powered speed is directed downstream), and in nocturnal insects at least, the downwind headings are seemingly maintained by direct detection of wind-related turbulent cues. Despite being far more abundant and speciose, the day-flying windborne migrant fauna has been much less studied by radar; thus the frequency of wind-related common orientation patterns and the sensory mechanisms involved in their formation remain to be established. Here, we analyze a large dataset of {\textgreater}600,000 radar-detected "medium-sized" windborne insect migrants (body mass from 10 to 70 mg), flying hundreds of meters above southern UK, during the afternoon, in the period around sunset, and in the middle of the night. We found that wind-related common orientation was almost ubiquitous during the day (present in 97{\%} of all "migration events" analyzed), and was also frequent at sunset (85{\%}) and at night (81{\%}). Headings were systematically offset to the right of the flow at night-time (as predicted from the use of turbulence cues for flow assessment), but there was no directional bias in the offsets during the day or at sunset. Orientation "performance" significantly increased with increasing flight altitude throughout the day and night. We conclude by discussing sensory mechanisms which most likely play a role in the selection and maintenance of wind-related flight headings.},

abstract = {Just as the Wright brothers implemented controls to achieve stable airplane flight, flying insects have evolved behavioral strategies that ensure recovery from flight disturbances. Pioneering studies performed on tethered and dissected insects demonstrate that the sensory, neurological, and musculoskeletal systems play important roles in flight control. Such studies, however, cannot produce an integrative model of insect flight stability because they do not incorporate the interaction of these systems with free-flight aerodynamics. We directly investigate control and stability through the application of torque impulses to freely flying fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) and measurement of their behavioral response. High-speed video and a new motion tracking method capture the aerial "stumble," and we discover that flies respond to gentle disturbances by accurately returning to their original orientation. These insects take advantage of a stabilizing aerodynamic influence and active torque generation to recover their heading to within 2 degrees in {\textless}60 ms. To explain this recovery behavior, we form a feedback control model that includes the fly's ability to sense body rotations, process this information, and actuate the wing motions that generate corrective aerodynamic torque. Thus, like early man-made aircraft and modern fighter jets, the fruit fly employs an automatic stabilization scheme that reacts to short time-scale disturbances.},

However, the so-called constant tau-dot strategy proposed to explain how we regulate our deceleration in such circumstances is critically examined and rejected. New directions in the problem of braking control are proposed that emphasize: (1) the advantage of tau-dot over other kinematic variables; (2) the task specificity of tau-dot; (3) the need to consider tau-dot as a control variable; and (4) the role played by the controller dynamics in the perception-action loop.

abstract = {Foraging rates of honeybees have been found to be definitely influenced by several environmental factors. The impact of air temperature proved to be the most important of the weather conditions. Rising temperature significantly increases the speed of flower visits and simultaneously decreases the number of flowers visited per inflorescence. Sky covered has slight reserved effect whilst light wind (below 4.5 m per sec) and flight distance within 600 metres do not affect the foraging rates of honeybees on red clover inflorescences. Strong wind decreases the speed of flower visits or prevents it. It is concluded that increasing length of corolla tube and decreasing amount and/or availability of nectar affect adversely the flower visiting speed. The type of behaviour is also important, since pure pollen gatherers are much more rapid flower visitors than the remaining behavioural classes whose foraging rates are closely similar to each other at the same locality. The details suggest that the foraging rates of honeybees are governed by a host of factors none of which seem to be highly superior to the others. For this reason, the foraging rates of honeybees are always affected by a complex system of factors individual components of which can partly interfere with or support each other, however, certain factors tend to have geographical tendencies.

abstract = {The flight control systems of flying insects enable many kinds of sophisticated maneuvers, including avoidance of midair collisions. Visuomotor response to an approaching object, received as image expansion on insects' retina, is a complex event in a dynamic environment where both animals and objects are moving. There are intensive free flight studies on the landing response in which insects receive image expansion by their own movement. However, few studies have been conducted regarding how freely flying insects respond to approaching objects. Here, using common laboratory insects for behavioral research, the bumblebee Bombus ignitus, we examined their visual response to an approaching object in the free-flying condition. While the insect was slowly flying in a free-flight arena, an expanding stripe was projected laterally from one side of the arena with a high-speed digital mirror device projector. Rather than turning away reported before, the bumble bees performed complex flight maneuvers. We synchronized flight trajectories, orientations and wing stroke frequencies with projection parameters of temporal resolution in 0.5 ms, and analyzed the instantaneous relationship between visual input and behavioral output. In their complex behavioral responses, we identified the following two visuomotor behaviors: increasing stroke frequency when the bumble bees confront the stripe expansion, and turning towards (not away) the stripe expansion when it is located laterally to the bee. Our results suggested that the response to object expansion is not a simple and reflexive escape but includes object fixation, presumably for subsequent behavioral choice.

abstract = {Landing is a challenging aspect of flight because, to land safely, speed must be decreased to a value close to zero at touchdown. The mechanisms by which animals achieve this remain unclear. When landing on horizontal surfaces, honey bees control their speed by holding constant the rate of front-to-back image motion (optic flow) generated by the surface as they reduce altitude. As inclination increases, however, this simple pattern of optic flow becomes increasingly complex. How do honey bees control speed when landing on surfaces that have different orientations? To answer this, we analyze the trajectories of honey bees landing on a vertical surface that produces various patterns of motion. We find that landing honey bees control their speed by holding the rate of expansion of the image constant. We then test and confirm this hypothesis rigorously by analyzing landings when the appar- ent rate of expansion generated by the surface is manipulated artificially. This strategy ensures that speed is reduced, gradually and automatically, as the surface is approached. We then develop a mathematical model of this strategy and show that it can effectively be used to guide smooth landings on surfaces of any orientation, including horizontal surfaces. This biological strategy for guiding landings does not require knowledge about either the distance to the surface or the speed at which it is approached. The simplicity and generality of this landing strategy suggests that it is likely to be exploited by other flying animals and makes it ideal for implementation in the guidance systems of flying robots. vision},

abstract = {Based on a survey of over eleven thousand controllers in the refining, chemi-cals and pulp and paper industries, 97{\%} of regulatory controllers utilize PID feedback. Desborough Honeywell, 2000, see [DM02]. PID control is by far the most common way of using feedback in natural and man-made systems. PID controllers are commonly used in industry and a large factory may have thousands of them, in instruments and lab-oratory equipment. In engineering applications the controllers appear in many different forms: as a stand alone controller, as part of hierarchical, distributed control systems, or built into embedded components. Most con-trollers do not use derivative action. In this chapter we discuss the basic ideas of PID control and the methods for choosing the parameters of the controllers. Many aspects of control can be understood based on linear analysis. However, there is one nonlinear effect, that has to be considered in most control systems namely that actuators saturate. In combinations with controllers having integral actions saturations give rise to an effect called integral windup. This phenomenon that occurs in practically all control systems will be discussed in depth for PID controllers. Methods to avoid windup will also be presented. Finally we will also discuss implementation of PID controllers, similar methods can be used to implement many other controllers. 301 302 CHAPTER 10.

The control signal is thus a sum of three terms: a proportional term that is proportional to the error, an integral term that is proportional to the integral of the error, and a derivative term that is proportional to the derivative of the error. The controller parameters are proportional gain k p , integral gain k i and derivative gain k d . The controller can also be parameterized as u(t) = k p e(t) + 1 T i},

abstract = {Insects are attractive models for the development of micro-aerial vehicles (MAVs) due to their relatively simple sensing, actuation and control architectures as compared to vertebrates, and because of their robust flight ability in dynamic and heterogeneous environments, characterized by turbulence and gusts of wind. How do insects respond to gust perturbations? We investigated this question by perturbing freely-flying honey bees and stalk-eye flies with low-pressure bursts of compressed air to simulate a wind gust. Body and wing kinematics were analyzed from flight sequences, recorded using three high-speed digital video cameras. Bees quickly responded to body rotations caused by gusts through bilateral asymmetry in stroke amplitude, whereas stalk-eye flies used a combination of asymmetric stroke amplitude and wing rotation angle. Both insects coordinated asymmetric and symmetric kinematics in response to gusts, which provides model strategies for simple yet robust flight characteristics for MAVs.},

abstract = {Nectar standing crops in flowers within an individual plant are often highly variable. This variability may be a by-product of the foraging activity of insect pollinators. Alternatively, plants may be selected to produce highly variable rewards to reduce consecutive visitation by risk-averse pollinators, thus diminishing within-plant pollen transfer. This study evaluated the roles of pollinator control vs. plant control over nectar variability in the bee-pollinated shrub Rosmarinus officinalis L. (Lamiaceae). We sampled nectar production, standing crop and pollinator visits in three shrubs of one population over 17 days during one blooming season. Nectar production rates were highly variable (CV = 1.48), and increased after rainy days. Nectar standing crops were even more variable (CV = 2.16), decreased with increasing temperatures, and increased with time since the last rain. Pollinator visit rates decreased with variability in nectar standing crops, increased with flower number per shrub, and were unaffected by variability in nectar production rates. Repeated sampling of marked flowers revealed no correlation between their nectar standing crops and production rates. These findings support the role of reward variance in reducing pollinator visits, but suggest that plants are not in complete control of this variability. Rather, plant-generated variability can be modified by intensive foraging activity of pollinators. Such pollinator control over nectar variability is likely to reduce the selective advantage of plant-generated reward variation.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Shedding of vortices is a common phenomenon in the atmosphere over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. However, it is unclear how these vortices of varying scales affect the flight performance of flying animals. In order to examine these interactions we trained seven hawkmoths (Manduca sexta) (wingspan {\~{}}9 cm) to fly and feed in a wind tunnel under steady flow (controls) and in the Von K{\'{a}}rm{\'{a}}n vortex street of vertically oriented cylinders (two different cylinders with diameters of 10 and 5 cm) at speeds of 0.5, 1 and 2 ms-1. Cylinders were placed at distances of 5, 25 and 100 cm upstream of the moths. Moths exhibited large amplitude yaw oscillations coupled with modest oscillations in roll and pitch, and slight increases in wingbeat frequency when flying in both the near (recirculating) and middle (vortex dominated) wake regions. Wingbeat amplitude did not vary among treatments, except at 1 ms-1 for the large cylinder. Yaw and roll oscillations were synchronized with the vortex shedding frequencies in moths flying in the wake of the large cylinder at all speeds. In contrast, yaw and pitch were synchronized with the shedding frequency of small vortices at speeds ≤ 1 ms-1. Oscillations in body orientation were also substantially smaller in the small cylinder treatment when compared to the large cylinder, regardless of temporal or non-dimensional spatial scale. Moths flying in steady conditions reached a higher air speed than into cylinder wakes. In general, flight effects produced by the cylinder wakes were qualitatively similar among the recirculating and vortex dominated wake regions; the magnitude of those effects, however, declined gradually with downstream distance.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The natural wind environment that volant insects encounter is unsteady and highly complex, posing significant flight control and stability challenges. Unsteady airflows can range from structured chains of discrete vortices shed in the wake of an object to fully developed chaotic turbulence. It is critical to understand the flight control strategies insects employ to safely navigate in natural environments. We combined experiments on free flying bumblebees with high fidelity numerical simulations and lower order modeling to identify the salient mechanics that mediate insect flight in unsteady winds. We trained bumblebees to fly upwind towards an artificial flower in a wind tunnel under steady wind and in a von Karman street (23Hz) formed in the wake of a cylinder. The bees displayed significantly higher movement in the unsteady vortex street compared to steady winds. Correlation analysis revealed that at lower frequencies, less than 10 Hz, in both steady and unsteady winds the bees mediated lateral movement with body roll, typical casting motion. At higher frequencies in unsteady winds there was a negative correlation between body roll and lateral accelerations. Numerical simulations of a bumblebee in similar conditions permitted the separation of the passive and active components of the flight trajectories. Comparison between the free-flying and numerical bees revealed a novel mechanism that enables bees to passively ride out high frequency perturbations while performing active maneuvers and corrections at lower frequencies. The capacity of maintaining stability by combining passive and active modes at different timescales provides a viable means for volant animals and machines to tackle the control challenges posed by complex airflows.},

abstract = {1. Observations were made on females of the yellow‐fever mosquito, Aedes (Stegomyia) wgypti, which had not had a blood meal. 2. When suspended by a silk fibre they orientated inaccurately but consistently away from the source of an horizontal beam of artificial light. 3. They orientated accurately towards a vertical black stripe on a white background, and would rotate maintaining this position when the stripe was rotated around them up to 25 revolutions per minute. 4. Presented with two black stripes the mosquitoes faced one or other stripe, and not between the two. Light stimulation of the front part of the eye evoked a more powerful turning‐away response than stimulation of the sides. 5. The mosquitoes were attracted by and followed stripes which were moving, abandoning stationary similarly striped or darker walls to do so. 6. Unsuspended, freely flying mosquitoes in a wind tunnel orientated consistently up wind, keeping position or making headway as long as the background was visible, but not in darkness. Without a wind, but with transverse stripes moving along the floor, they flew with or ahead of the stripe movement, the visual equivalent of flying up wind. 7. The above evidence that up wind orientation involves a visual “compensation” mechanism is discussed, and a theory of the mechanism put forward. 8. The lateral ommatidia initiate the responses to light and to moving objects, working in a different way from the dorsal and ventral ommatidia, which are concerned in up wind orientation. Interplay between the two classes of response may take place.

abstract = {Recent studies have shown that certain nocturnal insect and vertebrate species have true color vision under nocturnal illumination. Thus, their vision is potentially affected by changes in the spectral quality of twilight and nocturnal illumination, due to the presence or absence of the moon,artificial light pollution and other factors. We investigated this in the following manner. First we measured the spectral irradiance (from 300 to 700 nm) during the day, sunset, twilight, full moon, new moon, and in the presence of high levels of light pollution. The spectra were then converted to both human-based chromaticities and to relative quantum catches for the nocturnal hawkmoth Deilephila elpenor, which has color vision. The reflectance spectra of various flowers and leaves and the red hindwings of D. elpenor were also converted to chromaticities and relative quantum catches. Finally, the achromatic and chromatic contrasts (with and without von Kries color constancy) of the flowers and hindwings against a leaf background were determined under the various lighting environments. The twilight and nocturnal illuminants were substantially different from each other, resulting in significantly different contrasts. The addition of von Kries color constancy significantly reduced the effect of changing illuminants on chromatic contrast, suggesting that, even in this light-limited environment,the ability of color vision to provide reliable signals under changing illuminants may offset the concurrent threefold decrease in sensitivity and spatial resolution. Given this, color vision may be more common in crepuscular and nocturnal species than previously considered.},

It is shown how the driver could, in principle, use visual information about time to collision in registering when he is on a collision course, in judging when to start braking, and in controlling his ongoing braking. Implications of the theory for safe speeds and safe following distances are discussed, taking into account visual angular velocity detection thresholds, and some suggestions are made as to how safety on the roads might be improved.},

abstract = {Mean lift coefficients have been calculated for hawkmoth flight at a range of speeds in order to investigate the aerodynamic significance of the kinematic variation which accompanies changes in forward velocity. The coefficients exceed the maximum steady-state value of 0.71 at all except the very fastest speeds, peaking at 2.0 or greater between 1 and 2 ms-1. Unsteady high-lift mechanisms are therefore most important during hovering and slow forward flight. In combination with the wingtip paths relative to the surrounding air, the calculated mean lift coefficients illustrate how the relative contributions of the two halfstrokes to the force balance change with increasing forward speed. Angle of incidence data for fast forward flight suggest that the sense of the circulation is not reversed between the down- and upstrokes, indicating a flight mode qualitatively different from that proposed for lower-speed flight in the hawkmoth and other insects. The mid-downstroke angle of incidence is constant at 30-40 degrees across the speed range. The relationship between power requirements and flight speed is explored; above 5 ms-1, further increases in forward velocity are likely to be constrained by available mechanical power, although problems with thrust generation and flight stability may also be involved. Hawkmoth wing and body morphology, and the differences between males and females, are evaluated in aerodynamic terms. Steady-state force measurements show that the hawkmoth body is amongst the most streamlined for any insect.},

abstract = {High-speed movies of dragonflies turning in flight on flexible tethers show that there are two distinct modes of turning. In the 'conventional' mode, dragonflies use left-right asymmetries in the wing stroke amplitude, and occasionally in the angle of attack, to produce more lift and thrust on one side than the other. This causes the animal to roll into a bank, so that the lift vector has a sideward component; this sideward component produces the turn, much as in an aeroplane. This type of turn is probably most useful during fast forward flight. The second mode of turning is the 'yaw turn'. Yaw turns are accomplished without banking, and the dragonfly's long axis may turn more than 90° in the period of two wing strokes. The kinematics of this turn could not be as closely analysed, but it appears that dragonflies use drag on the inner wing upstroke and the outer wing downstroke to turn, much like pivoting a rowing boat. This turn may be hampered by drag on the abdomen during fast forward flight and would be most useful at low speeds or during hovering.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} Bumblebee foragers spend a significant portion of their lives transporting nectar and pollen, often carrying loads equivalent to more than half their body mass. Whereas nectar is stored in the abdomen near the bee's center of mass, pollen is carried on the hind legs, farther from the center of mass. We examine how load position changes the rotational moment of inertia in bumblebees and whether this affects their flight maneuverability and/or stability. We applied simulated pollen or nectar loads of equal mass to {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Bombus impatiens{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} bumblebees and examined flight performance in a wind tunnel under three conditions: flight in unsteady flow, tracking an oscillating flower in smooth flow, and flower tracking in unsteady flow. Using an inertial model, we estimated that carrying a load on the legs rather than in the abdomen increases a bee's moment of inertia about the roll and yaw axes but not the pitch axis. Consistent with these predictions, we found that bees carrying a load on their legs displayed slower rotations about their roll and yaw axes, regardless of whether these rotations were driven by external perturbations or self-initiated steering maneuvers. This allowed pollen-loaded bees to maintain a more stable body orientation and higher median flight speed in unsteady flow but reduced their performance when tracking a moving flower, supporting the concept of a tradeoff between stability and maneuverability. These results demonstrate that the types of resources collected by bees affect their flight performance and energetics and suggest that wind conditions may influence resource selection. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Flies display a sophisticated suite of aerial behaviours that require rapid sensory{\^{}}motor processing. Like all insects, {\pounds}ight control in {\pounds}ies is mediated in part by motion-sensitive visual interneurons that project to steering motor circuitry within the thorax. Flies, however, possess a unique {\pounds}ight control equilibrium sense that is encoded by mechanoreceptors at the base of the halteres, small dumb-bell-shaped organs derived through evolutionary transformation of the hind wings. To study the input of the haltere system onto the {\pounds}ight control system, I constructed a mechanically oscillating {\pounds}ight arena consisting of a cylindrical array of light-emitting diodes that generated the moving image of a 308 vertical stripe. The arena provided closed-loop visual feedback to elicit ¢xation behaviour, an orientation response in which {\pounds}ies maintain the position of the stripe in the front portion of their visual ¢eld by actively adjusting their wing kinematics. While {\pounds}ies orientate towards the stripe, the entire arena was swung back and forth while an optoelectronic device recorded the compensatory changes in wing stroke amplitude and frequency. In order to reduce the background changes in stroke kinematics resulting from the animal's closed-loop visual ¢xation behaviour, the responses to eight identical mechanical rotations were averaged in each trial. The results indicate that {\pounds}ies possess a robust equilibrium re{\pounds}ex in which angular rotations of the body elicit compensatory changes in both the amplitude and stroke frequency of the wings. The results of uni-and bilateral ablation experiments demonstrate that the halteres are required for these stability re{\pounds}exes. The results also con¢rm that halteres encode angular velocity of the body by detecting the Coriolis forces that result from the linear motion of the haltere within the rotating frame of reference of the {\pounds}y's thorax. By rotating the {\pounds}ight arena at di¡erent orientations, it was possible to construct a complete directional tuning map of the haltere-mediated re{\pounds}exes. The directional tuning of the re{\pounds}ex is quite linear such that the kinematic responses vary as simple trigonometric functions of stimulus orientation. The re{\pounds}exes function primarily to stabilize pitch and yaw within the horizontal plane.},

abstract = {Moving animals orchestrate myriad motor systems in response to multimodal sensory inputs. Coordinating movement is particularly challenging in flight control, where animals deal with potential instability and multiple degrees of freedom of movement. Prior studies have focused on wings as the primary flight control structures, for which changes in angle of attack or shape are used to modulate lift and drag forces. However, other actuators that may impact flight performance are reflexively activated during flight. We investigated the visual-abdominal reflex displayed by the hawkmoth Manduca sexta to determine its role in flight control. We measured the open-loop stimulus-response characteristics (measured as a transfer function) between the visual stimulus and abdominal response in tethered moths. The transfer function reveals a 41 ms delay and a high-pass filter behavior with a pass band starting at similar to 0.5. Hz. We also developed a simplified mathematical model of hovering flight wherein articulation of the thoracic-abdominal joint redirects an average lift force provided by the wings. We show that control of the joint, subject to a high-pass filter, is sufficient to maintain stable hovering, but with a slim stability margin. Our experiments and models suggest a novel mechanism by which articulation of the body or 'airframe' of an animal can be used to redirect lift forces for effective flight control. Furthermore, the small stability margin may increase flight agility by easing the transition from stable flight to a more maneuverable, unstable regime.},

abstract = {Size polymorphism is an important life history trait in bumblebees with strong impact on individual behavior and colony organization. Within a colony larger workers tend to serve as foragers, while smaller workers fulfill in-hive tasks. It is often assumed that size-dependent division of labor relates to differences in task performance. In this study we examined size-dependent interindividual variability in foraging, i.e. whether foraging behavior and foraging capability of bumblebee workers are affected by their size. We observed two freely foraging Bombus terrestris colonies and measured i) trip number, ii) trip time, iii) proportion of nectar trips, and iv) nectar foraging rate of different sized foragers. In all observation periods large foragers exhibited a significantly higher foraging rate than small foragers. None of the other three foraging parameters was affected by worker size. Thus, large foragers contributed disproportionately more to the current nectar influx of their colony. We provide a detailed discussion of the possible proximate mechanisms underlying the differences in foraging rate.},

abstract = {Global climate model simulations from the 'Half a degree Additional warming, Prognosis and Projected Impacts' (HAPPI) project were used to assess how wind power generation over Europe would change in a future world where global temperatures reach 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels. Comparing recent historical (2006-2015) and future 1.5 °C forcing experiments highlights that the climate models demonstrate a northward shift in the Atlantic jet, leading to a significant (p {\textless} 0.01) increase in surface winds over the UK and Northern Europe and a significant (p {\textless} 0.05) reduction over Southern Europe. We use a wind turbine power model to transform daily near-surface (10 m) wind speeds into daily wind power output, accounting for sub-daily variability, the height of the turbine, and power losses due to transmission and distribution of electricity. To reduce regional model biases we use bias-corrected 10 m wind speeds. We see an increase in power generation potential over much of Europe, with the greatest increase in load factor over the UK of around four percentage points. Increases in variability are seen over much of central and northern Europe with the largest seasonal change in summer. Focusing on the UK, we find that wind energy production during spring and autumn under 1.5 °C forcing would become as productive as it is currently during the peak winter season. Similarly, summer winds would increase driving up wind generation to resemble levels currently seen in spring and autumn. We conclude that the potential for wind energy in Northern Europe may be greater than has been previously assumed, with likely increases even in a 1.5 °C warmer world. While there is the potential for Southern Europe to see a reduction in their wind resource, these decreases are likely to be negligible.},

@article{Lillywhite1979,
abstract = {IN our attempts to unravel the workings of visual systems, we seek neural responses and interactions which can account for visual behaviour. A popular measure of visual performance is the threshold intensity at which a stimulus is detected with a given probability. To account for these detection tasks, one must not only measure neural signals at threshold1,2, but also find the limiting sources of variance (that is, the noise) both within3 and outside4,5 the nervous system6. The manner in which the random nature of photon absorptions can limit the performance of visual systems is well understood4,5,7,8. When bleaching effects are negligible, photon absorptions follow the Poisson distribution. Consequently photon counts derived from the same mean signal have a variance equal to their mean. These fluctuations in counts are an inherent property of photon signals and are referred to as photon shot noise. Processes within the visual system generate intrinsic noise7, but to assess its effect on thresholds one must first account for photon shot noise. This is generally difficult because photon catch cannot be measured directly, and must be estimated from optical parameters which are subject to significant error7. We have estimated the levels of photon shot noise and intrinsic transducer noise9 in locust photoreceptors at low light intensities. We have chosen to search for sources of intrinsic noise in the visual system of the locust because it has recently been shown that, at low intensities, each effective photon produces a single, large quantum bump10 (Fig. 1). Thus, we measure precisely the number of photons contributing to photoreceptor signals and derive, from the total response variance, that additional variance due to intrinsic noise. We report here that the transducer noise mimics the properties of photon shot noise, is of similar magnitude, and, in most conditions, must have an equally significant role in determining thresholds.},

abstract = {During hovering flight, animals can increase the wing velocity and therefore the net aerodynamic force per stroke by increasing wingbeat frequency, wing stroke amplitude, or both. The magnitude and orientation of aerodynamic forces are also influenced by the geometric angle of attack, timing of wing rotation, wing contact, and pattern of deviation from the primary stroke plane. Most of the kinematic data available for flying animals are average values for wing stroke amplitude and wingbeat frequency because these features are relatively easy to measure, but it is frequently suggested that the more subtle and difficult-to-measure features of wing kinematics can explain variation in force production for different flight behaviors. Here, we test this hypothesis with multicamera high-speed recording and digitization of wing kinematics of honeybees (Apis mellifera) hovering and ascending in air and hovering in a hypodense gas (heliox: 21{\%} O2, 79{\%} He). Bees employed low stroke amplitudes (86.7° ± 7.9°) and high wingbeat frequencies (226.8 ± 12.8 Hz) when hovering in air. When ascending in air or hovering in heliox, bees increased stroke amplitude by 30{\%}-45{\%}, which yielded a much higher wing tip velocity relative to that during simple hovering in air. Across the three flight conditions, there were no statistical differences in the amplitude of wing stroke deviation, minimum and stroke-averaged geometric angle of attack, maximum wing rotation velocity, or even wingbeat frequency. We employed a quasi-steady aerodynamic model to estimate the effects of wing tip velocity and geometric angle of attack on lift and drag. Lift forces were sensitive to variation in wing tip velocity, whereas drag was sensitive to both variation in wing tip velocity and angle of attack. Bees utilized kinematic patterns that did not maximize lift production but rather maintained lift-to-drag ratio. Thus, our data indicate that, at least for honeybees, the overall time course of wing angles is generally preserved and modulation of wing tip velocity is sufficient to perform a diverse set of vertical flight behaviors.},

Is their flight inherently stable? If so, how can they maneuver so well? In recent years, significant progress has been made in revealing the dynamic flight stability and flight control mechanisms of insects and has partially answered these questions. Here the most recent advances in this active area are reviewed. The aim is to provide the background necessary to do research in the area and raise questions that need to be addressed in the future. This review begins with an overview of the flapping kinematics and aerodynamics of insect flight. It is followed by a summary of the governing equations of insect motion and the simplified theoretical models used for analysis of dynamic stability and control. Next, the stability properties of hovering flight and forward flight are scrutinized. Then the flight control properties are explored, dealing in turn with flight stabilization control, steady-state control for changing from hovering to forward flight and from one forward-flight speed to another, and control for maneuvers near hovering. Finally, remarks are given on the state of the art of this research field and speculation is made on its outlook in the near future.},

Participants viewed closed-loop displays of approach to an object and regulated their deceleration with a brake. The object appeared on a checkerboard ground surface (providing velocity, distance, and size information) or with no background (providing only optical expansion). Mean tau-dot during braking was -0.51, and estimates of the critical value of tau-dot based on brake adjustments were -0.44 and -0.52, close to the expected value. There were no overall effects of the ground surface or object size. The results are consistent with a tau-dot strategy, where the direction and magnitude of brake adjustments are regulated using tau-dot. {\textcopyright} 1995 American Psychological Association.},

Evolutionary robotics techniques were used to develop models of visually-guided braking behavior in humans to aid in resolving existing questions in the literature. Based on a well-used experimental paradigm from psychology, model agents were evolved to solve a driving-like braking task in a simple 2D environment involving one object. Agents had five sensors to detect image size of the object, image expansion rate, tau, tau-dot and proportional rate, respectively. These optical variables were those tested in experimental investigations of visually guided-braking in humans. The aim of the present work was to investigate which of these optical variables were used by the evolved agents to solve the braking task when all variables were available to control braking. Our results indicated that the agent with the highest performance used exclusively proportional rate to control braking. The agent with the lowest performance was found to be using primarily tau-dot together with image size and image expansion rate.},

abstract = {To avoid crashing onto the floor, a free falling fly needs to trigger its wingbeats quickly and control the orientation of its thrust accurately and swiftly to stabilize its pitch and hence its speed. Behavioural data have suggested that the vertical optic flow produced by the fall and crossing the visual field plays a key role in this anti-crash response. Free fall behavior analyses have also suggested that flying insect may not rely on graviception to stabilize their flight. Based on these two assumptions, we have developed a model which accounts for hoverflies´ position and pitch orientation recorded in 3D with a fast stereo camera during experimental free falls. Our dynamic model shows that optic flow-based control combined with closed-loop control of the pitch suffice to stabilize the flight properly. In addition, our model sheds a new light on the visual-based feedback control of fly´s pitch, lift and thrust. Since graviceptive cues are possibly not used by flying insects, the use of a vertical reference to control the pitch is discussed, based on the results obtained on a complete dynamic model of a virtual fly falling in a textured corridor. This model would provide a useful tool for understanding more clearly how insects may or not estimate their absolute attitude.},

We investigated the effects of wind and temperature on honey bees, Apis mellifera, foraging on two plant varieties, Lavandula x intermedia ‘Grosso' and Origanum vulgare to determine how wind influences foraging behaviour and whether responses differ between the plant varieties. Fans and an artificial wind break were used to generate wind speeds from 0 to 3.5 m/s with the following behaviours examined in a minute of foraging: number of flower visits, handling time per flower, interflower flight duration and proportion of flowers walked to. Flower movement was quantified using video footage and imageJ tracking software. Bees visited significantly fewer flowers with increasing wind speed on both plant varieties, with an average decrease of 38{\%} between the lowest and highest wind speeds. However, the reduction was significantly steeper when foraging on O. vulgare. The reduction was due to an increase in handling time on both varieties, with interflower flight duration unaffected. Temperature had no effect on flower visit rate for either plant variety. The only behaviour influenced by flower movement was handling time, which was found to increase with flower movement. However, this increase did not result in fewer flower visits. Our results support previous work on artificial flowers which determined that the direct effect of wind on the bee influences foraging efficiency and behaviour more than the indirect effect of flower movement.},

Manipulation of pattern motion revealed that the speed of flight is controlled by regulating the image motion that is experienced by the eyes. Flight speed is surprisingly robust to changes in the contrast and/or spatial texture of the visual environment, suggesting that the underlying movement-detecting mechanisms estimate the speed of image motion in the eye largely independently of these parameters. This ensures that flight speed depends primarily on the distances to nearby surfaces and not upon their particular visual properties, such as contrast or visual texture. The removal of image motion cues drastically compromises the regulation of flight speed, underscoring their role in this function.},

abstract = {Flight is a complicated task at the centimetre scale particularly due to unsteady air fluctuations which are ubiquitous in outdoor flight environments. Flying organisms deal with these difficulties using active and passive control mechanisms to steer their body motion. Body attitudes of flapping organisms are linked with their resultant flight trajectories and performance, yet little is understood about howisolated unsteady aerodynamic phenomena affect the interlaced dynamics of such systems. In this study, we examined freely flying bumblebees subject to a single isolated gust to emulate aerodynamic disturbances encountered in nature. Bumblebees are expert commanders of the aerial domain as they persistently forage within complex terrain elements. By tracking the three-dimensional dynamics of bees flying through gusts, we determined the sequences of motion that permit flight in three disturbance conditions: sideward, upward and downward gusts. Bees executed a series of passive impulsive maneuvers followed by active recovery maneuvers. Impulsive motion was unique in each gust direction, maintaining control by passive manipulation of the body. Bees pitched up and slowed down at the beginning of recovery in every disturbance, followed by corrective maneuvers which brought body attitudes back to their original state. Bees were displaced the most by the sideward gust, displaying large lateral translations and roll deviations. Upward gusts were easier for bees to fly through, causing only minor flight changes and minimal recovery times. Downward gusts severely impaired the control response of bees, inflicting strong adverse forces which sharply upset trajectories. Bees used a variety of control strategies when flying in each disturbance, offering new insights into insect-scale flapping flight and bio-inspired robotic systems.},

abstract = {Insects use feedback from a variety of sensory modalities, including mechanoreceptors on their antennae, to stabilize the direction and speed of flight. Like all arthropod appendages, antennae not only supply sensory information but may also be actively positioned by control muscles. However, how flying insects move their antennae during active turns and how such movements might influence steering responses are currently unknown. Here we examined the antennal movements of flying Drosophila during visually induced turns in a tethered flight arena. In response to both rotational and translational patterns of visual motion, Drosophila actively moved their antennae in a direction opposite to that of the visual motion. We also observed two types of passive antennal movements: small tonic deflections of the antenna and rapid oscillations at wing beat frequency. These passive movements are likely the result of wing-induced airflow and increased in magnitude when the angular distance between the wing and the antenna decreased. In response to rotational visual motion, increases in passive antennal movements appear to trigger a reflex that reduces the stroke amplitude of the contralateral wing, thereby enhancing the visually induced turn. Although the active antennal movements significantly increased antennal oscillation by bringing the arista closer to the wings, it did not significantly affect the turning response in our head-fixed, tethered flies. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that flying Drosophila use mechanosensory feedback to detect changes in the wing induced airflow during visually induced turns and that this feedback plays a role in regulating the magnitude of steering responses.},

abstract = {The means by which brains transform sensory information into coherent motor actions is poorly understood. In flies, a relatively small set of descending interneurons are responsible for conveying sensory information and higher-order commands from the brain to motor circuits in the ventral nerve cord. Here, we describe three pairs of genetically identified descending interneurons that integrate information from wide-field visual interneurons and project directly to motor centers controlling flight behavior. We measured the physiological responses of these three cells during flight and found that they respond maximally to visual movement corresponding to rotation around three distinct body axes. After characterizing the tuning properties of an array of nine putative upstream visual interneurons, we show that simple linear combinations of their outputs can predict the responses of the three descending cells. Last, we developed a machine vision-tracking system that allows us to monitor multiple motor systems simultaneously and found that each visual descending interneuron class is correlated with a discrete set of motor programs.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Most animals possess specialized sensory systems for encoding body rotation, which they use for stabilizing posture and regulating motor actions. In flies and other insects, the visual system contains an array of specialized neurons that integrate local optic flow to estimate body rotation during locomotion. However, the manner in which the output of these cells is transformed by the downstream neurons that innervate motor centers is poorly understood. We have identified a set of three visual descending neurons that integrate the output of nine large-field visual interneurons and project directly to flight motor centers. Our results provide new insight into how the sensory information that encodes body motion is transformed into a code that is appropriate for motor actions.},

abstract = {Here we provide the first formal quantitative analysis of dynamic stability in a flying animal. By measuring the longitudinal static stability derivatives and mass distribution of desert locusts Schistocerca gregaria, we find that their static stability and static control responses are insufficient to provide asymptotic longitudinal dynamic stability unless they are sensitive to pitch attitude (measured with respect to an inertial or earth-fixed frame) as well as aerodynamic incidence (measured relative to the direction of flight). We find no evidence for a 'constant-lift reaction', previously supposed to keep lift production constant over a range of body angles, and show that such a reaction would be inconsequential because locusts can potentially correct for pitch disturbances within a single wingbeat. The static stability derivatives identify three natural longitudinal modes of motion: one stable subsidence mode, one unstable divergence mode, and one stable oscillatory mode (which is present with or without pitch attitude control). The latter is identified with the short period mode of aircraft, and shown to consist of rapid pitch oscillations with negligible changes in forward speed. The frequency of the short period mode (approx. 10 Hz) is only half the wingbeat frequency (approx. 22 Hz), so the mode would become coupled with the flapping cycle without adequate damping. Pitch rate damping is shown to be highly effective for this purpose - especially at the small scales associated with insect flight - and may be essential in stabilising locust flight. Although having a short period mode frequency close to the wingbeat frequency risks coupling, it is essential for control inputs made at the level of a single wingbeat to be effective. This is identified as a general constraint on flight control in flying animals.},

abstract = {Our understanding of how variable wind in natural environments affects flying insects is limited because most studies of insect flight are conducted in either smooth flow or still air conditions. Here, we investigate the effects of structured, unsteady flow (the von Karman vortex street behind a cylinder) on the flight performance of bumblebees (Bombus impatiens). Bumblebees are 'all-weather' foragers and thus frequently experience variable aerial conditions, ranging from fully mixed, turbulent flow to unsteady, structured vortices near objects such as branches and stems. We examined how bumblebee flight performance differs in unsteady versus smooth flow, as well as how the orientation of unsteady flow structures affects their flight performance, by filming bumblebees flying in a wind tunnel under various flow conditions. The three-dimensional flight trajectories and orientations of bumblebees were quantified in each of three flow conditions: (1) smooth flow, (2) the unsteady wake of a vertical cylinder (inducing strong lateral disturbances) and (3) the unsteady wake of a horizontal cylinder (inducing strong vertical disturbances). In both unsteady conditions, bumblebees attenuated the disturbances induced by the wind quite effectively, but still experienced significant translational and rotational fluctuations as compared with flight in smooth flow. Bees appeared to be most sensitive to disturbance along the lateral axis, displaying large lateral accelerations, translations and rolling motions in response to both unsteady flow conditions, regardless of orientation. Bees also displayed the greatest agility around the roll axis, initiating voluntary casting maneuvers and correcting for lateral disturbances mainly through roll in all flow conditions. Both unsteady flow conditions reduced the upstream flight speed of bees, suggesting an increased cost of flight in unsteady flow, with potential implications for foraging patterns and colony energetics in natural, variable wind environments.},

The results reveal that (1) landing bees approach the surface at a relatively shallow descent angle; (2) they tend to hold the angular velocity of the image of the surface constant as they approach it; and (3) the instantaneous speed of descent is proportional to the instantaneous forward speed. These characteristics reflect a surprisingly simple and effective strategy for achieving a smooth landing, by which the forward and descent speeds are automatically reduced as the surface is approached and are both close to zero at touchdown. No explicit knowledge of flight speed or height above the ground is necessary. A model of the control scheme is developed and its predictions are verified. It is also shown that, during landing, the bee decelerates continuously and in such a way as to keep the projected time to touchdown constant as the surface is approached. The feasibility of this landing strategy is demonstrated by implementation in a robotic gantry equipped with vision.},

abstract = {Controls required for small-speed lateral flight of a model insect were studied using techniques based on the linear theories of stability and control (the stability and control derivatives were computed by the method of computational fluid dynamics). The main results are as follows. (1) Two steady-state lateral motions can exist: one is a horizontal side translation with the body rolling to the same side of the translation by a small angle, and the other is a constant-rate yaw rotation (rotation about the vertical axis). (2) The side translation requires an anti-symmetrical change in the stroke amplitudes of the contralateral wings, and/or an anti-symmetrical change in the angles of attack of the contralateral wings, with the down- and upstroke angles of attack of a wing having equal change. The constant-rate yaw rotation requires an anti-symmetrical change in the angles of attack of the contralateral wings, with the down- and upstroke angles of attack of a wing having differential change. (3) For the control of the horizontal side translation, control input required for the steady-state motion has an opposite sign to that needed for initiating the motion. For example, to have a steady-state left side-translation, the insect needs to increase the stroke amplitude of the left wing and decrease that of the right wing to maintain the steady-state flight, but it needs an opposite change in stroke amplitude (decreasing the stroke amplitude of the left wing and increasing that of the right wing) to enter the flight.},

The quasi-steady wing aerodynamics model is extended by including perturbation states from equilibrium and paired with rigid body equations of motion to create a nonlinear simulation of a Drosophila-like insect. Frequency-based system identification tools are used to identify the transfer functions from biologically inspired control inputs to rigid body states. Stability derivatives and a state space linear system describing the dynamics are also identified. The vehicle control requirements are quantified with respect to traditional human pilot handling qualities specification. The heave dynamics are found to be decoupled from the pitch/fore/aft dynamics. The haltere-on system revealed a stabilized system with a slow (heave) and fast subsidence mode, and a stable oscillatory mode. The haltere-off (bare airframe) system revealed a slow (heave) and fast subsidence mode and an unstable oscillatory mode, a modal structure in agreement with CFD studies. The analysis indicates that passive aerodynamic mechanisms contribute to stability, which may help explain how insects are able to achieve stable locomotion on a very small computational budget. {\textcopyright}2010.},

abstract = {Recent research has uncovered a number of different ways in which bees use cues derived from optic flow for navigational purposes. The distance flown to a food source is gauged by integrating the apparent motion of the visual world that is experienced en route. In other words, bees possess a visually driven 'odometer' that is robust to variations in wind load and energy expenditure. Bees flying through a tunnel maintain equidistance to the flanking walls by balancing the apparent speeds of the images of the walls. This strategy enables them to negotiate narrow passages or to fly between obstacles. The speed of flight in a tunnel is controlled by holding constant the average image velocity as seen by the two eyes. This avoids potential collisions by ensuring that the bee slows down when flying through narrow passages. Bees landing on a horizontal surface hold constant the image velocity of the surface as they approach it. This automatically ensures that flight speed decreases with altitude and is close to zero at touchdown. The movement-sensitive mechanisms underlying these various behaviours seem to be different, qualitatively as well as quantitatively, from those mediating the well-investigated optomotor response.},

abstract = {The sparse sensing and limited articulation that are characteristic of human-engineered robotic systems contrast dramatically with sensorimotor systems observed in nature. Animals are richly imbued with sensors, have many points of articulation and are heavily over-actuated. In fact, the compliant nature of the body (or Plant) of most animals requires constant control input to the muscles for postural maintenance. In this study, we show how flying insects use a compliant airframe to maintain flight stability via active articulation of the frame. We first derive the equations of motion for a model flying insect, inspired by the hawkmoth, a large fast flying and agile insect. By linearizing the equations of motion about a hovering equilibrium, we demonstrate that abdominal motions are sufficient to stabilize flight on a scale of 50ms.We then tested whether these insects use the abdomen for flight control by first measuring the open-loop transfer function between visual pitch rotations and abdominal movement in a tethered moth preparation. The measured transfer function was consistent with an abdominal control strategy.We then closed the loop and found that moths actively stabilize visual pitch rotations using abdominal motion as the only control input. The behavior was robust to variations in gain and to a variety of visual stimuli. These experiments establish airframe articulation as a plausible control mechanism for active flight.},

abstract = {Partamona helleri stingless bees construct a unique, funnel-shaped entrance that resolves an evolutionary conflict between foraging efficiency and defence. The large outer entrance allows many foragers to pass while the narrow inner entrance requires few guards to defend. This structure has given rise to a remarkable behaviour in returning foragers, which appear to approach the nest entrance at high speed and ‘crash' head first into the entrance. We compared P. helleri landing behaviour with two related species with architecturally different entrances that land conventionally using their legs: Melipona scutellaris, whose narrow entrance allows only a single bee to pass, and Scaptotrigona depilis, which has a wide entrance tube. All three species initially decelerated on their approach to the nest entrance. However, 0.2 m from the entrance P. helleri began accelerating, whereas the other species continued to decelerate. Partamona helleri entered its nest at 1.14 ms−1, double the velocity of the other species. Despite its greater velocity, P. helleri made no fewer errors than the other species when attempting to enter its nest, probably by virtue of the large target provided by the outer entrance. We then used a bioassay that suggests that this behaviour is a defence against ambush predators at the nest entrance. Finally, we use a scaling argument to show that the crash impact should not cause any damage to a small animal such as a bee, such that no morphological adaptation is required.},

abstract = {In response to the pressures of predation, parasitism and competition for limited resources, several groups of (mainly) tropical bees and wasps have independently evolved a nocturnal lifestyle. Like their day-active (diurnal) relatives, these insects possess apposition compound eyes, a relatively light-insensitive eye design that is best suited to vision in bright light. Despite this, nocturnal bees and wasps are able to forage at night, with many species capable of flying through a dark and complex forest between the nest and a foraging site, a behaviour that relies heavily on vision and is limited by light intensity. In the two best-studied species - the Central American sweat bee Megalopta genalis (Halictidae) and the Indian carpenter bee Xylocopa tranquebarica (Apidae) - learned visual landmarks are used to guide foraging and homing. Their apposition eyes, however, have only around 30 times greater optical sensitivity than the eyes of their closest diurnal relatives, a fact that is apparently inconsistent with their remarkable nocturnal visual abilities. Moreover, signals generated in the photoreceptors, even though amplified by a high transduction gain, are too noisy and slow to transmit significant amounts of information in dim light. How have nocturnal bees and wasps resolved these paradoxes? Even though this question remains to be answered conclusively, a mounting body of theoretical and experimental evidence suggests that the slow and noisy visual signals generated by the photoreceptors are spatially summed by second-order monopolar cells in the lamina, a process that could dramatically improve visual reliability for the coarser and slower features of the visual world at night.},

abstract = {[A high speed (1000 frame/s) video segment, 0.367 seconds long, showing a territorial male Pachydiplax longipennis dragonfly responding in the field to a challenge from a conspecific male, reveals that the defender used a high rate yaw-turn to position itself to drive off the challenger. In-phase flapping of the fore and hind wings was used during the yaw turn and in the following pursuit of the challenger. During the right yawing turn, the dragonfly flapped its right wings to a more negative stroke amplitude than its left wings on the first two downstrokes (1st downstroke: -65° right wing, -45° left wing; 2nd downstroke: -90° right wing, -50° left wing). Upstroke amplitudes were the same for both wings throughout the yaw turn. The 135° yaw turn was executed, in three wing beats (0.085 s) and in about 6/10ths of a body length of horizontal travel, at an average yaw rate of 1590°/s., and a peak turn rate of 3000°/s. This rapid yawing rotation was accompanied by a significant deceleration in flight path speed, which dropped from 30 to 7 body lengths per second (1.1 m/s to 0.3 m/s) as the dragonfly yawed through 90° in the first half of the yaw turn. The wingbeat frequency dropped from 41.7 Hz at the beginning of the yaw turn to 33.3 Hz at the end. The horizontal and vertical flight velocity components both reached zero near the completion of the yaw turn, during the upstroke portion of the third wing beat. Within 1/10th of a second after completing the yaw turn, the defender had reached speeds of 8 body lengths per second (0.3 m/s) upward and 14 body lengths per second (0.55 m/s) horizontally, and was accelerating along its flight path at approximately 150 body lengths per second 2 (5.5 m/s²) in its pursuit of the challenger.]},

abstract = {This book is the only account of what the bee, as an example of an insect, actually detects with its eyes. Bees detect some visual features such as edges and colours, but there is no sign that they reconstruct patterns or put together features to form objects. Bees detect motion but have no perception of what it is that moves, and certainly they do not recognize “things” by their shapes. Yet they clearly see well enough to fly and find food with a minute brain. Bee vision is therefore relevant to the construction of simple artificial visual systems, for example for mobile robots. The surprising conclusion is that bee vision is adapted to the recognition of places, not things. In this volume, Adrian Horridge also sets out the curious and contentious history of how bee vision came to be understood, with an account of a century of neglect of old experimental results, errors of interpretation, sharp disagreements, and failures of the scientific method. The design of the experiments and the methods of making inferences from observations are also critically examined, with the conclusion that scientists are often hesitant, imperfect and misleading, ignore the work of others, and fail to consider alternative explanations. The erratic path to understanding makes interesting reading for anyone with an analytical mind who thinks about the methods of science or the engineering of seeing machines.},

abstract = {Body movements of flying insects change their effective wing kinematics and, therefore, influence aerodynamic force and torque production. It was found that substantial aerodynamic damping is produced by flapping wings through a passive mechanism termed flapping countertorque during fast yaw turns. We expand this study to include the aerodynamic damping that is produced by flapping wings during body translations and rotations with respect to all its six principal axesroll, pitch, yaw, forward/backward, sideways, and heave. Analytical models were derived by the use of a quasi-steady aerodynamic model and blade-element analysis by the incorporation of the effective changes of wing kinematics that are caused by body motion. We found that aerodynamic damping, in all these cases, is linearly dependent on the body translational and angular velocities and increases with wing-stroke amplitude and frequency. Based on these analytical models, we calculated the stability derivatives that are associated with the linearized flight dynamics at hover and derived a complete 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) dynamic model. The model was then used to estimate the flight dynamics and stability of four different species of flying insects as case studies. The analytical model that is developed in this paper is important to study the flight dynamics and passive stability of flying animals, as well as to develop flapping-wing micro air vehicles (MAVs) with stable and maneuverable flight, which is achieved through passive dynamic stability and active flight control. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {SignificanceMany insects carry substantial loads during flight. Although this behavior is often critical for survival and reproduction, few studies have examined its consequences for flight performance. Bumblebees regularly carry two types of loads in different locations: pollen on their legs or nectar in their abdomen. We found that when bees carry a pollen load rather than a nectar load, they are more stable but less maneuverable in flight, supporting the concept of a tradeoff between stability and maneuverability--a notion that is frequently suggested but has rarely been tested, particularly in flying insects. Our findings also suggest that wind conditions may influence what resources pollinators choose to collect, which would have important consequences for pollination dynamics and colony fitness. Bumblebee foragers spend a significant portion of their lives transporting nectar and pollen, often carrying loads equivalent to more than half their body mass. Whereas nectar is stored in the abdomen near the bee's center of mass, pollen is carried on the hind legs, farther from the center of mass. We examine how load position changes the rotational moment of inertia in bumblebees and whether this affects their flight maneuverability and/or stability. We applied simulated pollen or nectar loads of equal mass to Bombus impatiens bumblebees and examined flight performance in a wind tunnel under three conditions: flight in unsteady flow, tracking an oscillating flower in smooth flow, and flower tracking in unsteady flow. Using an inertial model, we estimated that carrying a load on the legs rather than in the abdomen increases a bee's moment of inertia about the roll and yaw axes but not the pitch axis. Consistent with these predictions, we found that bees carrying a load on their legs displayed slower rotations about their roll and yaw axes, regardless of whether these rotations were driven by external perturbations or self-initiated steering maneuvers. This allowed pollen-loaded bees to maintain a more stable body orientation and higher median flight speed in unsteady flow but reduced their performance when tracking a moving flower, supporting the concept of a tradeoff between stability and maneuverability. These results demonstrate that the types of resources collected by bees affect their flight performance and energetics and suggest that wind conditions may influence resource selection.},

abstract = {This paper presents the development and experimental validation of a bio-inspired autopilot, called TauPilot, based on the ecological tau theory proposed by the psychologist David Lee. Tau theory postulates that animals and humans use a combination of simple guidance strategies and the tau variable (t ) (representing time-to-contact) to prospectively guide and control most of their purposeful movements. This research investigates the feasibility and effectiveness of applying tau theory principles to guidance and control of movement in four dimensions (three spatial dimensions plus time), with application to various crucial maneuvres of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) such as braking, automated aerial docking and automatic landing. TauPilot includes a tau-guidance system, a tau-navigation system and a tau-controller, resulting in a four-dimensional (4D) guidance, navigation and control system that has the capability to accurately fit maneuvres or actions into 4D slots using only the universal temporal variable, tau. TauPilot has been integrated into two rotorcraft UAS and demonstrated in more than 1000 successful tau-controlled flights. TauPilot provided the UAS with the capability to perform the following maneuvres with high spatial and temporal accuracy: tau-braking, 4D straight- and curved-path tau-docking to a virtual target (a three-dimensional point in space), vertical and 4D coordinated tau-landing, and 4D tau-interception of a moving target point. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2013.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Flying animals maneuver and hover through environments where wind gusts and flower wakes produce unsteady flow. Although both flight maneuvers and aerodynamic mechanisms have been studied independently, little is known about how these interact in an environment where flow is already unsteady. Moths forage from flowers by hovering in the flower's wake. We investigate hawkmoths tracking a 3D-printed robotic flower in a wind tunnel. We visualize the flow in the wake and around the wings and compare tracking performance to previous experiments in a still air flight chamber. Like in still air, moths flying in the flower wake exhibit near perfect tracking at low frequencies where natural flowers move. However, tracking in the flower wake results in a larger overshoot between 2-5 Hz. System identification of flower tracking reveals that moths also display reduced-order dynamics in wind, compared to still air. Smoke visualization of the flower wake shows that the dominant vortex shedding corresponds to the same frequency band as the increased overshoot. Despite these large effects on tracking dynamics in wind, the leading edge vortex (LEV) remains bound to the wing throughout the wingstroke and does not burst. The LEV also maintains the same qualitative structure seen in steady air. Persistence of a stable LEV during decreased flower tracking demonstrates the interplay between hovering and maneuvering.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Many manual and locomotor tasks require the actor to reach a certain position in space, while reducing movement velocity close to zero. The 'tau- dot' variable, the first temporal derivative of the current time-to-contact, was suggested to play a critical role in the prospective control of deceleration (e.g. Lee, 1976; Yilmaz {\&} Warren, 1995). Lane changing can be considered as a biphasic task, where in a first phase a lateral velocity is produced (pull-out), which then has to be minimized in a second phase (approach to the envisaged lane). This second alignment phase necessarily requires prospective control of the lateral deceleration. Here we asked, whether lane changing might be guided by tau-dot, resulting in a lateral approach to the new lane with tau-dot values kept constant at or regulated around -0.5. In a driving simulation using a large cylindrical projection screen (7m diameter), 46 participants were asked to drive in a 3.5 m wide straight lane and to perform consecutive lane changes to an adjacent lane. The deceleration of 1460 trajectories of the second phase were analyzed, computing fit and slope of a linear regression of time-to-contact with respect to time. We found that two-thirds of the lane changes can be described by a single tau-dot value (criterion r {\textgreater} 0.6, mean r = 0.94). These trials yield a mean tau-dot of -0.499 (sd = 0.132), which is in suprising agreement with the theoretical value of -0.5. Futhermore, we observed also a positive correlation (r = 0.68) between the time required for the completion of the lane change and the tau-dot values. Our results complement previous studies showing evidence for the use of the tau-dot variable, even when the point of termination of the approach was largely self-defined, as it was true for our task. Drivers prefered a path with a constant lateral deceleration, despite the non-linear relationship between lateral deceleration and steering-wheel amplitude.},

abstract = {Red-blue emitting LEDs have recently been introduced in greenhouses to optimise plant growth. However, this spectrum may negatively affect the performance of bumblebees used for pollination, because the visual system of bumblebees is more sensitive to green light than to red-blue light. We used high-speed stereoscopic videography to three-dimensionally track and compare landing manoeuvres of Bombus terrestris bumblebees in red-blue light and in regular, broad-spectrum white light. In both conditions, the landing approaches were interspersed by one or several hover phases, followed by leg extension and touchdown. The time between leg extension and touchdown was 25{\%} (0.05 s) longer in red-blue light than in white light, caused by a more tortuous flight path in red-blue light. However, the total landing duration, specified as the time between the first hover phase and touchdown, did not differ between the light conditions. This suggests that the negative effects of red-blue light on the landing manoeuvre are confined to the final phase of the landing.

Even though landing is a crucial part of pollination, little is known about how bumblebees orchestrate the final, critical moments of landing. Here, we use high-speed recordings to capture the fine details of the landing behaviour of free-flying bumblebees (Bombus terrestris), while landing on a flat platform with different orientations. We find that the bees have a fairly constant body and head orientation at the moment of leg extension, irrespective of platform tilt. At the same moment in time, the distance to the platform is held constant at around 8 mm (with the exception of low platform tilts). The orientation of the antennae and the first appendage that touches the platform vary between platform orientations, while the duration of the hover phase does not. Overall, the final moments of landing in bumblebees and their close relatives, the honeybees, are similar. However, the distance to the platform at the moment of leg extension and the duration of the hover phase are different in bumblebees and honeybees, suggesting that they are primarily adapted to land on surfaces with different orientations.},

abstract = {Landing maneuvers of flies are complex behaviors which can be conceptually decomposed into sequences of modular actions, including body-deceleration, leg-extension, and body rotations. These behavioral 'modules' must be coordinated to ensure well-controlled landing. The composite nature of these behaviors induces kinematic variability, making it difficult to identify the central rules that govern landing. Many previous studies have relied on tethered preparations to study landing behaviors, but tethering induces experimental artefacts by forcing some behaviors to operate in open-feedback control loop while others remain closed-loop. On the other hand, it is harder for the experimenter to control the stimuli experienced by freely-flying insects. One approach towards understanding general mechanisms of landing is to determine the common elements of their kinematics on surfaces of different orientations. We conducted a series of experiments in which the houseflies, Musca domestica, were lured to land on vertical (wall landings) or inverted (ceiling landings) substrates, while their flight was recorded with multiple highspeed cameras. We observed that, in both cases, well-controlled landings occurred when the distance at which flies initiated deceleration was proportional to flight velocity component in the direction of substrate. The ratio of substrate distance and velocity at onset of deceleration (tau) was conserved, despite substantial differences in mechanics of vertical vs. ceiling landings. When these conditions were not satisfied, their landing performance was compromised, causing their heads to collide into the substrate. Unlike body-deceleration, leg-extension in flies was independent of substrate distance or approach velocity. Thus, the robust reflexive visual initiation of deceleration is independent of substrate orientation, and combines with a more variable initiation of leg-extension which depends on surface orientation. Together, these combinations of behaviors enable flies to land in a versatile manner on substrates of various orientations.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT. Males of two species of moths (Grapholitha molesta (Busck) and Heliothis virescens (F.)) were flown in a sustained‐flight tunnel in horizontal pheromone plumes. The up‐tunnel velocity of the moths increased with increasing height of flight and for G.molesta was independent of tunnel wind velocities. Use of moving ground patterns verified that the height of flight above the ground was the factor related to the changes in up‐tunnel velocity. Even though up‐tunnel velocity increased with increased flight height, angular velocity of image motion did not. Males appeared to use visual cues from the ground pattern and from other sources to determine their up‐tunnel velocities. The relationship of preferred retinal velocities to optomotor anemotaxis is discussed. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1982, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

abstract = {High-speed videography was used to record sequences of individual hawkmoths in free flight over a range of speeds from hovering to 5 ms-1. At each speed, three successive wingbeats were subjected to a detailed analysis of the body and wingtip kinematics and of the associated time course of wing rotation. Results are presented for one male and two female moths. The clearest kinematic trends accompanying increases in forward speed were an increase in stroke plane angle and a decrease in body angle. The latter may have resulted from a slight dorsal shift in the area swept by the wings as the supination position became less ventral with increasing speed. These trends were most pronounced between hovering and 3 ms-1, and the changes were gradual; there was no distinct gait change of the kind observed in some vertebrate fliers. The wing rotated as two functional sections: the hindwing and the portion of the forewing with which it is in contact, and the distal half of the forewing. The latter displayed greater fluctuation in the angle of rotation, especially at the lower speeds. As forward speed increased, the discrepancy between the rotation angles of the two halfstrokes, and of the two wing sections, became smaller. The downstroke wing torsion was set early in the halfstroke and then held constant during the translational phase.},

abstract = {Reduction of echolocation call source levels in bats has previously been studied using set-ups with one microphone. By using a 16 microphone array, sound pressure level (SPL) variations, possibly caused by the scanning movements of the bat, can be excluded and the sonar beam aiming can be studied. During the last two meters of approach flights to a landing platform in a large flight room, five big brown bats aimed sonar beams at the landing site and reduced the source level on average by 7 dB per halving of distance. Considerable variation was found among the five individuals in the amount of source level reduction ranging from 4 to 9 dB per halving of distance. These results are discussed with respect to automatic gain control and intensity compensation and the combination of the two effects. It is argued that the two effects together do not lead to a stable echo level at the cochlea. This excludes a tightly coupled closed loop feed back control system as an explanation for the observed reduction of signal SPL in landing big brown bats.},

abstract = {Flies and other insects use vision to regulate their groundspeed in flight, enabling them to fly in varying wind conditions. Compared with mechanosensory modalities, however, vision requires a long processing delay ({\~{}}100 ms) that might introduce instability if operated at high gain. Flies also sense air motion with their antennae, but how this is used in flight control is unknown. We manipulated the antennal function of fruit flies by ablating their aristae, forcing them to rely on vision alone to regulate groundspeed. Arista-ablated flies in flight exhibited significantly greater groundspeed variability than intact flies. We then subjected them to a series of controlled impulsive wind gusts delivered by an air piston and experimentally manipulated antennae and visual feedback. The results show that an antenna-mediated response alters wing motion to cause flies to accelerate in the same direction as the gust. This response opposes flying into a headwind, but flies regularly fly upwind. To resolve this discrepancy, we obtained a dynamic model of the fly's velocity regulator by fitting parameters of candidate models to our experimental data. The model suggests that the groundspeed variability of arista-ablated flies is the result of unstable feedback oscillations caused by the delay and high gain of visual feedback. The antenna response drives active damping with a shorter delay ({\~{}}20 ms) to stabilize this regulator, in exchange for increasing the effect of rapid wind disturbances. This provides insight into flies' multimodal sensory feedback architecture and constitutes a previously unknown role for the antennae.},

abstract = {The flight of insects is a beautiful example of an organism's complex interaction with its physical environment. Consider, for example, a fly's evasive dodge of an approaching swatter. The insect must orchestrate a cascade of events that starts with the visual system perceiving information that is then processed and transmitted through neural circuits. Next, muscle actions are triggered that induce changes to the insect's wing motions, and these motions interact with fluid flows to generate aerodynamic forces. Though not as obvious to appreciate, simply flying straight and keeping upright require similarly complex events in order to overcome unexpected disturbances and suppress intrinsic instabilities. Here, I present recent progress in dissecting the many layers that comprise maneuvering and stabilization in the flight of the fruit fly, D. melanogaster. My emphasis is on aspects of flight at the interface of biology and physics, and I seek to understand how physical effects both constrain and simplify biological strategies. This body of work roughly divides into three thrusts: the development of experimental and modeling methods, studies of actuation and control of maneuvering flight, and studies of control during flight stabilization. In Chapter 2, I discuss the experimental techniques we have developed for gathering many three-dimensional high-speed videos of insect flight. In addition, I outline our approach for automated extraction of body and wing motions from such videos. In Chapter 3, I show how experimental observations can be combined with aero- dynamic models to reveal that fruit flies use paddling motions to drive forward flight. In Chapter 4, I review our work on turning maneuvers with an emphasis on how the wing motions themselves arise through an actuation mechanism. In Chapter 5, I outline a set of experimental and modeling techniques for understanding how insects recover from in-flight perturbations to their heading. In Chapter 6, I use a similar approach to analyze the intrinsic instability of body pitch and predict the reaction time needed to stabilize flight. In Chapter 7, I include work on the hydrodynamic interactions between flapping bodies in a fluid flow.},

@article{Wu2004,
abstract = {The unsteady aerodynamic forces of a model fruit fly wing in flapping motion were investigated by numerically solving the Navier–Stokes equations. The flapping motion consisted of translation and rotation [the translation velocity (ut) varied according to the simple harmonic function (SHF), and the rotation was confined to a short period around stroke reversal]. First, it was shown that for a wing of given geometry with ut varying as the SHF, the aerodynamic force coefficients depended only on five non-dimensional parameters, i.e. Reynolds number (Re), stroke amplitude (F), mid-stroke angle of attack (am), non-dimensional duration of wing rotation ({\AE}tr) and rotation timing [the mean translation velocity at radius of the second moment of wing area (U), the mean chord length (c) and c/U were used as reference velocity, length and time, respectively]. Next, the force coefficients were investigated for a case in which typical values of these parameters were used (Re=200; F=150°; am=40°; {\AE}tr was 20{\%} of wingbeat period; rotation was symmetrical). Finally, the effects of varying these parameters on the force coefficients were investigated. In the Re range considered (20–1800), when Re was above {\~{}}100, the lift (CL) and drag (CD) coefficients were large and varied only slightly with Re (in agreement with results previously published for revolving wings); the large force coefficients were mainly due to the delayed stall mechanism. However, when Re was below {\~{}}100, CL decreased and CD increased greatly. At such low Re, similar to the case of higher Re, the leading edge vortex existed and attached to the wing in the translatory phase of a half-stroke; but it was very weak and its vorticity rather diffused, resulting in the small CL and large CD. Comparison of the calculated results with available hovering flight data in eight species (Re ranging from 13 to 1500) showed that when Re was above {\~{}}100, lift equal to insect weight could be produced but when Re was lower than {\~{}}100, additional high-lift mechanisms were needed. In the range of Re above {\~{}}100, F from 90° to 180° and {\AE}tr from 17{\%} to 32{\%} of the stroke period (symmetrical rotation), the force coefficients varied only slightly with Re, F and {\AE}tr. This meant that the forces were approximately proportional to the square of Fn (n is the wingbeat frequency); thus, changing F and/or n could effectively control the magnitude of the total aerodynamic force. The time course of CL (or CD) in a half-stroke for ut varying according to the SHF resembled a half sinewave. It was considerably different from that published previously for ut, varying according to a trapezoidal function (TF) with large accelerations at stroke reversal, which was characterized by large peaks at the beginning and near the end of the half-stroke. However, the mean force coefficients and the mechanical power were not so different between these two cases (e.g. the mean force coefficients for ut varying as the TF were approximately 10{\%} smaller than those for ut varying as the SHF except when wing rotation is delayed).},

abstract = {Bees often forage in habitats with cluttered vegetation and unpredictable winds. Navigating obstacles in wind presents a challenge that may be exacerbated by wind-induced motions of vegetation. Although wind-blown vegetation is common in natural habitats, we know little about how the strategies of bees for flying through clutter are affected by obstacle motion and wind. We filmed honeybees Apis mellifera flying through obstacles in a flight tunnel with still air, headwinds or tailwinds. We tested how their ground speeds and centering behavior (trajectory relative to the midline between obstacles) changed when obstacles were moving versus stationary, and how their approach strategies affected flight outcome (successful transit versus collision). We found that obstacle motion affects ground speed: bees flew slower when approaching moving versus stationary obstacles in still air but tended to fly faster when approaching moving obstacles in headwinds or tailwinds. Bees in still air reduced their chances of colliding with obstacles (whether moving or stationary) by reducing ground speed, whereas flight outcomes in wind were not associated with ground speed, but rather with improvement in centering behavior during the approach. We hypothesize that in challenging flight situations (e.g. navigating moving obstacles in wind), bees may speed up to reduce the number of wing collisions that occur if they pass too close to an obstacle. Our results show that wind and obstacle motion can interact to affect flight strategies in unexpected ways, suggesting that wind-blown vegetation may have important effects on foraging behaviors and flight performance of bees in natural habitats.},

abstract = {Background: While considerable scientific effort has been devoted to studying how birds navigate over long distances, relatively little is known about how targets are detected, obstacles are avoided and smooth landings are orchestrated. Here we examine how visual features in the environment, such as contrasting edges, determine where a bird will land. Methodology/Principal Findings: Landing in budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus) was investigated by training them to fly from a perch to a feeder, and video-filming their landings. The feeder was placed on a grey disc that produced a contrasting edge against a uniformly blue background. We found that the birds tended to land primarily at the edge of the disc and walk to the feeder, even though the feeder was in the middle of the disc. This suggests that the birds were using the visual contrast at the boundary of the disc to target their landings. When the grey level of the disc was varied systematically, whilst keeping the blue background constant, there was one intermediate grey level at which the budgerigar's preference for the disc boundary disappeared. The budgerigars then landed randomly all over the test surface. Even though this disc is (for humans) clearly distinguishable from the blue background, it offers very little contrast against the background, in the red and green regions of the spectrum. Conclusions: We conclude that budgerigars use visual edges to target and guide landings. Calculations of photoreceptor excitation reveal that edge detection in landing budgerigars is performed by a color-blind luminance channel that sums the signals from the red and green photoreceptors, or, alternatively, receives input from the red double-cones. This finding has close parallels to vision in honeybees and primates, where edge detection and motion perception are also largely color-blind. {\textcopyright} 2009 Bhagavatula et al.},

abstract = {Natural environments are characterized by variable wind that can pose significant challenges for flying animals and robots. However, our understanding of the flow conditions that animals experience outdoors and how these impact flight performance remains limited. Here, we combine laboratory and field experiments to characterize wind conditions encountered by foraging bumblebees in outdoor environments and test the effects of these conditions on flight. We used radio-frequency tags to track foraging activity of uniquely identified bumblebee ( Bombus impatiens ) workers, while simultaneously recording local wind flows. Despite being subjected to a wide range of speeds and turbulence intensities, we find that bees do not avoid foraging in windy conditions. We then examined the impacts of turbulence on bumblebee flight in a wind tunnel. Rolling instabilities increased in turbulence, but only at higher wind speeds. Bees displayed higher mean wingbeat frequency and stroke amplitude in these conditions, as well as increased asymmetry in stroke amplitude—suggesting that bees employ an array of active responses to enable flight in turbulence, which may increase the energetic cost of flight. Our results provide the first direct evidence that moderate, environmentally relevant turbulence affects insect flight performance, and suggest that flying insects use diverse mechanisms to cope with these instabilities.},

abstract = {Flies achieve supreme flight maneuverability through a small set of miniscule steering mus-cles attached to the wing base. The fast flight maneuvers arise from precisely timed activa-tion of the steering muscles and the resulting subtle modulation of the wing stroke. In addition, slower modulation of wing kinematics arises from changes in the activity of indirect flight muscles in the thorax. We investigated if these modulations can be described as a su-perposition of a limited number of elementary deformations of the wing stroke that are under independent physiological control. Using a high-speed computer vision system, we re-corded the wing motion of tethered flying fruit flies for up to 12 000 consecutive wing strokes at a sampling rate of 6250 Hz. We then decomposed the joint motion pattern of both wings into components that had the minimal mutual information (a measure of statistical depen-dence). In 100 flight segments measured from 10 individual flies, we identified 7 distinct types of frequently occurring least-dependent components, each defining a kinematic pat-tern (a specific deformation of the wing stroke and the sequence of its activation from cycle to cycle). Two of these stroke deformations can be associated with the control of yaw torque and total flight force, respectively. A third deformation involves a change in the downstroke-to-upstroke duration ratio, which is expected to alter the pitch torque. A fourth kinematic pat-tern consists in the alteration of stroke amplitude with a period of 2 wingbeat cycles, extend-ing for dozens of cycles. Our analysis indicates that these four elementary kinematic patterns can be activated mutually independently, and occur both in isolation and in linear superposition. The results strengthen the available evidence for independent control of yaw torque, pitch torque, and total flight force. Our computational method facilitates systematic identification of novel patterns in large kinematic datasets.},

abstract = {A quasi-steady aerodynamic model in consideration of the center of pressure (C.P.) was developed for insect flight. A dynamically scaled-up robotic hawkmoth wing was used to obtain the translational lift, drag, moment and rotational force coefficients. The translational force coefficients were curve-fitted with respect to the angles of attack such that two coefficients in the Polhamus leading-edge suction analogy model were obtained. The rotational force coefficient was also compared to that derived by the standard Kutta-Joukowski theory. In order to build the accurate pitching moment model, the locations of the C.Ps. and its movements depending on the pitching velocity were investigated in detail. We found that the aerodynamic moment model became suitable when the rotational force component was assumed to act on the half-chord. This implies that the approximation borrowed from the conventional airfoil concept, i.e., the 'C.P. at the quarter-chord' may lead to an incorrect moment prediction. In the validation process, the model showed excellent time-course force and moment estimations in comparison with the robotic wing measurement results. A fully nonlinear multibody flight dynamic simulation was conducted to check the effect of the traveling C.P. on the overall flight dynamics. This clearly showed the importance of an accurate aerodynamic moment model.},

abstract = {A crepuscular or nocturnal lifestyle has evolved in bees several times independently, probably to explore rewarding pollen sources without competition and to minimize predation and nest parasites. Despite these obvious advantages, only few bee species are nocturnal. Here we show that the sensitivity of the bee apposition eye is a major factor limiting the ability to forage in dim light. We present data on eye size, foraging times, and light levels for Megalopta genalis (Augochlorini, Halictidae) in Panama, and Lasioglossum (Sphecodogastra) sp. (Halictini, Halictidae) in Utah, USA. M. genalis females forage exclusively during twilight, but as a result of dim light levels in the rain forest, they are adapted to extremely low intensities. The likely factor limiting their foraging activity is finding their nest entrance on return from a foraging trip. The lowest light intensity at which they can do this, both in the morning and the evening, is 0.0001 cd m-2. Therefore, they leave the nest at dimmer light levels in the morning than in the evening. Lasioglossum (Sphecodogastra) foraging is limited by light intensity in the evening, but probably by temperature in the morning in the temperate climate of Utah. We propose that the evolution of nocturnality in bees was favored by the large variance in the size of females. {\textcopyright} The Author 2005.

abstract = {The lateral dynamic flight stability of a model bumblebee in hovering and forward flight is studied, using the method of computational fluid dynamics to compute the stability derivatives and the techniques of eigenvalue and eigenvector analysis for solving the equations of motion. The lateral motion of the model bumblebee is unstable at hovering and low flight speed (advance ratio J=0, 0.13), and becomes neutral or weakly stable at medium and high flight speeds (J=0.31-0.57). The instability at hovering and low speed is mainly caused by a positive roll-moment derivative with respect to the side-slip velocity, which is due to the effect of changing the axial velocity of the leading-edge-vortex (LEV) (i.e. the 'lateral wind' due to the side motion of the insect increases the axial velocity of the LEV on one wing and decreases that on the other wing). As flight speed increases, because the mean position of the wings moves more and more backward, the effect of 'changing-LEV-axial-velocity' becomes weaker and weaker and the roll-moment derivative decreases first and then changes its sign to become negative, resulting in the neutrally or weakly stable motion at medium and high flight speeds. {\textcopyright}2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The halteres are sensitive to Coriolis forces that result from angular rotations of the body and mediate corrective reflexes during flight. Like the aerodynamically functional fore wings, the halteres beat during flight and are equipped with their own set of control muscles. It is shown that motoneurons innervating muscles of the haltere receive strong excitatory input from directionally sensitive visual interneurons. Visually guided flight maneuvers of flies may be mediated in part by efferent modulation of hard-wired equilibrium reflexes.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Our understanding of how variable wind in natural environments affects flying insects is limited, because most studies of insect flight are conducted in either smooth flow or still air conditions. Here, we investigate the effects of structured, unsteady flow (the von Karman vortex street behind a cylinder) on the flight performance of bumblebees (Bombus impatiens). Bumblebees are "all-weather" foragers and thus frequently experience variable aerial conditions, ranging from fully mixed, turbulent flow to unsteady, structured vortices near objects such as branches and stems. We examined how bumblebee flight performance differs in unsteady versus smooth flow, as well as how the orientation of unsteady flow structures affects their flight performance, by filming bumblebees flying in a wind tunnel under various flow conditions. The three-dimensional flight trajectories and orientations of bumblebees were quantified in each of three flow conditions: (1) smooth flow, (2) the unsteady wake of a vertical cylinder (inducing strong lateral disturbances) and (3) the unsteady wake of a horizontal cylinder (inducing strong vertical disturbances). In both unsteady conditions, bumblebees attenuated the disturbances induced by the wind quite effectively, but still experienced significant translational and rotational fluctuations as compared to flight in smooth flow. Bees appeared to be most sensitive to disturbance along the lateral axis, displaying large lateral accelerations, translations, and rolling motions in response to both unsteady flow conditions, regardless of orientation. Bees also displayed the greatest agility around the roll axis, initiating voluntary casting maneuvers and correcting for lateral disturbances mainly through roll in all flow conditions. Both unsteady flow conditions reduced the upstream flight speed of bees, suggesting an increased cost of flight in unsteady flow, with potential implications for foraging patterns and colony energetics in natural, variable wind environments.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {When insects are flying forward, the image of the ground sweeps backward across their ventral viewfield and forms an "optic flow," which depends on both the groundspeed and the groundheight. To explain how these animals manage to avoid the ground by using this visual motion cue, we suggest that insect navigation hinges on a visual-feedback loop we have called the optic-flow regulator, which controls the vertical lift. To test this idea, we built a micro-helicopter equipped with an optic-flow regulator and a bio-inspired optic-flow sensor. This fly-by-sight micro-robot can perform exacting tasks such as take-off, level flight, and landing. Our control scheme accounts for many hitherto unexplained findings published during the last 70 years on insects' visually guided performances; for example, it accounts for the fact that honeybees descend in a headwind [1], land with a constant slope [2], and drown when travelling over mirror-smooth water [3]. Our control scheme explains how insects manage to fly safely without any of the instruments used onboard aircraft to measure the groundheight, groundspeed, and descent speed. An optic-flow regulator is quite simple in terms of its neural implementation and just as appropriate for insects as it would be for aircraft [4]. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The Arctic tern Sterna paradisaea is the epitome of such behavior; despite its small size ({\textless}125 g), banding recoveries and at-sea surveys suggest that its annual migration from boreal and high Arctic breeding grounds to the Southern Ocean may be the longest seasonal movement of any animal. Our tracking of 11 Arctic terns fitted with miniature (1.4-g) geolocators revealed that these birds do indeed travel huge distances (more than 80,000 km annually for some individuals). As well as confirming the location of the main wintering region, we also identified a previously unknown oceanic stopover area in the North Atlantic used by birds from at least two breeding populations (from Greenland and Iceland). Although birds from the same colony took one of two alternative southbound migration routes following the African or South American coast, all returned on a broadly similar, sigmoidal trajectory, crossing from east to west in the Atlantic in the region of the equatorial Intertropical Convergence Zone. Arctic terns clearly target regions of high marine productivity both as stopover and wintering areas, and exploit prevailing global wind systems to reduce flight costs on long-distance commutes.},

Similarly, large expanding flow-fields like those produced by locomotion may recipitate manoeuvres such as turning or landing8,9. From such observations it has been shown that the optic flow parameter, which specifies time to contact with the approaching object best fits the behavioural data10,11. We describe a subpopulation of neurons in the nucleus rotundus of the pigeon brain that respond selectively to objects moving on a collision course towards the bird. These neurons give their maximum response at a constant time before contact occurs, even when the size of the stimulus or its velocity is varied widely. We propose that these neurons are signalling the time to collision of approaching objects.},

The three main blocks constituting the flight dynamic framework of flapping MAVs are reviewed. These blocks are the flapping kinematics, the aerodynamic modeling, and the body dynamics. The design and parametrization of the flapping kinematics necessary to produce high-control authority over the MAV, as well as design of kinematics suitable for different flight conditions, are reviewed. Aerodynamic models used for analysis of flapping flight are discussed. Particular attention is given to the physical aspects captured by these models. The issues and consequences of averaging the dynamics and neglecting the wing inertia are discussed. The dynamic stability analysis of flapping MAVs is usually performed by either averaging, linearization and subsequent analysis or using Floquet theory. Both approaches are discussed. The linear and nonlinear control design techniques for flapping MAVs are also reviewed and discussed.},

abstract = {When flying through narrow spaces, insects control their position by balancing the magnitude of apparent image motion (optic flow) experienced in each eye and their speed by holding this value about a desired set point. Previously, it has been shown that when bumblebees encounter sudden changes in the proximity to nearby surfaces – as indicated by a change in the magnitude of optic flow on each side of the visual field – they adjust their flight speed well before the change, suggesting that they measure optic flow for speed control at low visual angles in the frontal visual field. Here, we investigated the effect that sudden changes in the magnitude of translational optic flow have on both position and speed control in bumblebees if these changes are asymmetrical; that is, if they occur only on one side of the visual field. Our results reveal that the visual region over which bumblebees respond to optic flow cues for flight control is not dictated by a set viewing angle. Instead, bumblebees appear to use the maximum magnitude of translational optic flow experienced in the frontal visual field. This strategy ensures that bumblebees use the translational optic flow generated by the nearest obstacles – that is, those with which they have the highest risk of colliding – to control flight.},

abstract = {Background: Some bees and wasps have evolved nocturnal behavior, presumably to exploit night-flowering plants or avoid predators. Like their day-active relatives, they have apposition compound eyes, a design usually found in diurnal insects. The insensitive optics of apposition eyes are not well suited for nocturnal vision. How well then do nocturnal bees and wasps see? What optical and neural adaptations have they evolved for nocturnal vision? Results: We studied female tropical nocturnal sweat bees (Megalopta genalis) and discovered that they are able to learn landmarks around their nest entrance prior to nocturnal foraging trips and to use them to locate the nest upon return. The morphology and optics of the eye, and the physiological properties of the photoreceptors, have evolved to give Megalopta's eyes almost 30 times greater sensitivity to light than the eyes of diurnal worker honeybees, but this alone does not explain their nocturnal visual behavior. This implies that sensitivity is improved by a strategy of photon summation in time and in space, the latter of which requires the presence of specialized cells that laterally connect ommatidia into groups. First-order interneurons, with significantly wider lateral branching than those found in diurnal bees, have been identified in the first optic ganglion (the lamina ganglionaris) of Megalopta's optic lobe. We believe that these cells have the potential to mediate spatial summation. Conclusions: Despite the scarcity of photons, Megalopta is able to visually orient to landmarks at night in a dark forest understory, an ability permitted by unusually sensitive apposition eyes and neural photon summation.},

abstract = {Turbulent winds and gusts fluctuate on a wide range of timescales from milliseconds to minutes and longer, a range that overlaps the timescales of avian flight behavior, yet the importance of turbulence to avian behavior is unclear. By combining wind speed data with the measured accelerations of a golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) flying in the wild, we find evidence in favor of a linear relationship between the eagle's accelerations and atmospheric turbulence for timescales between about 1/2 and 10 s. These timescales are comparable to those of typical eagle behaviors, corresponding to between about 1 and 25 wingbeats, and to those of turbulent gusts both larger than the eagle's wingspan and smaller than large-scale atmospheric phenomena such as convection cells. The eagle's accelerations exhibit power spectra and intermittent activity characteristic of turbulence and increase in proportion to the turbulence intensity. Intermittency results in accelerations that are occasionally several times stronger than gravity, which the eagle works against to stay aloft. These imprints of turbulence on the bird's movements need to be further explored to understand the energetics of birds and other volant life-forms, to improve our own methods of flying through ceaselessly turbulent environments, and to engage airborne wildlife as distributed probes of the changing conditions in the atmosphere.},

abstract = {Insect dispersal is affected by the wind and as a result, influenced by the presence of windbreaks. Wind reductions, microclimate modifications and vegetative diversity, influence insect distribution in sheltered areas. Wingless insects and very small insects generally depend on air currents to carry them to new sites, but they tend to settle in areas with low windspeeds. It is often more advantageous for a flying insect to remain within its boundary layer where windspeeds are lower than the insect's flight speed. Flying insects tend to accumulate in areas of reduced windspeed where they have greater control of flight; however, distribution patterns can be modified by directed movements in response to olfactory and visual stimuli. Many insect species are attracted to food and shelter within windbreaks. Windbreaks can concentrate insects in particular areas. Insects accumulate leeward of windbreaks as compared with unsheltered sites. The pattern of distribution may be affected by windspeed, angle of incidence of the wind, permeability of the windbreak, turbulence, source of insects (windbreak, local fields, upwind sites), insect behavior, insect species and vegetative composition. Windbreak vegetation may serve as a source of insect pests and their natural enemies and infestation levels in adjacent fields will be affected by their relative abundance. Knowledge of these distribution patterns should be considered when designing pest-management control strategies.},

abstract = {For organisms that fly or swim, movement results from the combined effects of the moving medium - air or water - and the organism's own locomotion. For larger organisms, propulsion contributes significantly to progress but the flow usually still provides significant opposition or assistance, or produces lateral displacement ('drift'). Animals show a range of responses to flows, depending on the direction of the flow relative to their preferred direction, the speed of the flow relative to their own self-propelled speed, the incidence of flows in different directions and the proportion of the journey remaining. We here present a classification of responses based on the direction of the resulting movement relative to flow and preferred direction, which is applicable to a range of taxa and environments. The responses adopted in particular circumstances are related to the organisms' locomotory and sensory capacities and the environmental cues available. Advances in biologging technologies and particle tracking models are now providing a wealth of data, which often demonstrate a striking level of convergence in the strategies that very different animals living in very different environments employ when moving in a flow. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Honeybees acquire wing damage as they age and older foraging honeybees accept lavender inflorescences with fewer flowers. These indicate the operation of some kind of optimal response, but this cannot be based on energy because energy expenditure does not change as the wings get damaged. However, wingbeat frequency increases with wing damage. A deterministic analytical model was constructed, based on the assumptions that bees have a limited total number of wingbeats that the flight motor can perform and that they maximize lifetime energy profit by conserving the number of wingbeats used in foraging. The optimal response to wing damage is to reduce the threshold number of flowers needed to accept an inflorescence. The predicted optimal gradient between wing damage (wingbeat frequency) and acceptance threshold (number of flowers on an inflorescence) was close to the observed gradient from field data. This model demonstrates that wear and tear is a significant factor in optimal foraging strategies. {\textcopyright} 2004 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {We provide a solution to a major problem in visually guided reaching. Research has shown that binocular vision plays an important role in the online visual guidance of reaching, but the visual information and strategy used to guide a reach remains unknown. We propose a new theory of visual guidance of reaching including a new information variable, $\tau$$\alpha$ (relative disparity $\tau$), and a novel control strategy that allows actors to guide their reach trajectories visually by maintaining a constant proportion between $\tau$$\alpha$ and its rate of change. The dynamical model couples the information to the reaching movement to generate trajectories characteristic of human reaching. We tested the theory in two experiments in which participants reached under conditions of darkness to guide a visible point either on a sliding apparatus or on their finger to a point-light target in depth. Slider apparatus controlled for a simple mapping from visual to proprioceptive space. When reaching with their finger, participants were forced, by perturbation of visual information used for feedforward control, to use online control with only binocular disparity-based information for guidance. Statistical analyses of trajectories strongly supported the theory. Simulations of the model were compared statistically to actual reaching trajectories. The results supported the theory, showing that $\tau$$\alpha$ provides a source of information for the control of visually guided reaching and that participants use this information in a proportional rate control strategy. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {When negotiating a narrow gap, honeybees tend to fly through the middle of the gap,  balancing the distances to the boundary on either side. To investigate the basis of this "centering response," bees were trained to fly through a tunnel on their way to a feeding site and back, while their flight trajectories were filmed from above. The wall on either side carried a visual pattern. When the patterns were stationary vertical gratings, bees tended to fly through the middle of the tunnel, i.e. along its longitudinal axis. However, when one of the gratings was in motion, bees flying in the same direction as the moving grating tended to fly closer to it, while bees flying in the opposite direction tended to fly closer to the stationary grating. This demonstrates, directly and unequivocally, that flying bees estimate the distances of surfaces in terms of the apparent motion of their images. A series of further experiments revealed that the distance to the gratings is gauged in terms of their apparent angular speeds, and that the visual system of the bee is capable of measuring angular speed largely independently of the spatial period, intensity profile, or contrast of the grating. Thus, the motion-sensitive mechanisms mediating range perception appear to be qualitatively different from those that mediate the well-known optomotor response in insects, or those involved in motion detection and ocular tracking in man.},

abstract = {Visually guided flight control in the rainforest is arguably one of the most complex insect behaviors: illumination varies dramatically depending on location [1], and the densely cluttered environment blocks out most of the sky [2]. What visual information do insects sample for flight control in this habitat? To begin answering this question, we determined the visual fields of the ocelli - thought to play a role in attitude stabilization of some flying insects [3-5] - of an orchid bee, Euglossa imperialis. High-resolution 3D models of the ocellar system from X-ray microtomography were used for optical ray tracing simulations. Surprisingly, these showed that each ocellus possesses two distinct visual fields - a focused monocular visual field suitable for detecting features elevated above the horizon and therefore assisting with flight stabilization [3-5] and, unlike other ocelli investigated to date [4, 6, 7], a large trinocular fronto-dorsal visual field shared by all ocelli. Histological analyses show that photoreceptors have similar orientations within each ocellus and are likely to be sensitive to polarized light, as in some other hymenopterans [7, 8]. We also found that the average receptor orientation is offset between the ocelli, each having different axes of polarization sensitivity relative to the head. Unlike the eyes of any other insect described to date, this ocellar system meets the requirements of a true polarization analyzer [9, 10]. The ocelli of E. imperialis could provide sensitive compass information for navigation in the rainforest and, additionally, provide cues for visual discrimination or flight control.},

abstract = {Landing is an important but understudied behavior that flying animals must perform constantly. In still air, insects decelerate smoothly prior to landing by employing the relatively simple strategy of maintaining a constant rate of image expansion during their approach. However, it is unclear whether insects employ this strategy when faced with challenging flight environments. Here, we tested the effects of wind on bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) landing on flowers. We find that bees' approach paths to flowers shift from multidirectional in still air to unidirectional in wind, regardless of flower orientation. In addition, bees landing in a 3.5 m s −1 headwind do not decelerate smoothly, but rather maintain a high flight speed until contact, resulting in higher peak decelerations upon impact. These findings suggest that wind has a strong influence on insect landing behavior and performance, with important implications for the design of micro aerial vehicles and the ecomechanics of insect flight.},

abstract = {In an attempt to better understand the mechanism underlying lateral collision avoidance in flying insects, we trained honeybees (Apis mellifera) to fly through a large (95-cm wide) flight tunnel. We found that, depending on the entrance and feeder positions, honeybees would either center along the corridor midline or fly along one wall. Bees kept following one wall even when a major (150-cm long) part of the opposite wall was removed. These findings cannot be accounted for by the “optic flow balance” hypothesis that has been put forward to explain the typical bees' “centering response” observed in narrower corridors. Both centering and wall-following behaviors are well accounted for, however, by a control scheme called the lateral optic flow regulator, i.e., a feedback system that strives to maintain the unilateral optic flow constant. The power of this control scheme is that it would allow the bee to guide itself visually in a corridor without having to measure its speed or distance from the walls.},

abstract = {Most bees forage for floral resources during the day, but temporal patterns of foraging activity vary extensively, and foraging in dim-light environments has evolved repeatedly. Facultative dim-light foraging behaviour is known in five of nine families of bees, while obligate behaviour is known in four families and evolved independently at least 19 times. The light intensity under which bees forage varies by a factor of 108, and therefore the evolution of dim-light foraging represents the invasion of a new, extreme niche. The repeated evolution of dim-light foraging behaviour in bees allows tests of the hypothesis that behaviour acts as an evolutionary pacemaker. With the exception of one species of Apis, facultative dim-light foragers show no external structural traits that are thought to enable visually mediated flight behaviour in low-light environments. By contrast, most obligate dim-light foragers show a suite of convergent optical traits such as enlarged ocelli and compound eyes. In one intensively studied species (Megalopta genalis) these optical changes are associated with neurobiological changes to enhance photon capture. The available ecological evidence suggests that an escape from competition for pollen and nectar resources and avoidance of natural enemies are driving factors in the evolution of obligate dim-light foraging.},

abstract = {Nature's flapping-wing flyers are adept at negotiating highly turbulent flows across a wide range of scales. This is in part due to their ability to quickly detect and counterract disturbances to their flight path, but may also be assisted by an inherent aerodynamic property of flapping wings. In this study, we subject a mechanical flapping wing to replicated atmospheric turbulence across a range of flapping frequencies and turbulence intensities. By means of flow visualization and surface pressure measurements, we determine the salient effects of large-scale freestream turbulence on the flow field, and on the phase-average and fluctuating components of pressure and lift. It is shown that at lower flapping frequencies, turbulence dominates the instantaneous flow field, and the random fluctuating component of lift contributes significantly to the total lift. At higher flapping frequencies, kinematic forcing begins to dominate and the flow field becomes more consistent from cycle to cycle. Turbulence still modulates the flapping-induced flow field, as evidenced in particular by a variation in the timing and extent of leading edge vortex formation during the early downstroke. The random fluctuating component of lift contributes less to the total lift at these frequencies, providing evidence that flapping wings do indeed provide some inherent gust mitigation.},

We find that this response, which was recently reported to be mediated by optic flow, is also strongly modulated by the presence of air flow simulating a head wind. The Johnston's organs in the antennae were found to play a role in the measurement of the air speed that is used to control the streamlining response. The response to a combination of visual motion and wind is complex and can be explained by a model that incorporates a non-linear combination of the two stimuli. The use of visual and mechanosensory cues increases the strength of the streamlining response when the stimuli are present concurrently. We propose this multisensory integration will make the response more robust to transient disturbances in either modality.},

abstract = {Flight is a complicated task at small scales in part due to the ubiquitous unsteady air which contains it. Flying organisms deal with these difficulties using active and passive control mechanisms to steer their body motion. Body attitudes of flapping organisms are linked with their resultant flight trajectories and performance, yet little is understood about how discrete unsteady aerodynamic phenomena affect the interlaced dynamics of such systems. In this study, we examined freely flying bumblebees subject to a single discrete gust to emulate aerodynamic disturbances encountered in nature. Bumblebees are expert commanders of the aerial domain as they persistently forage within complex terrain elements. Physical obstacles such as flowers produce local effects representative of a typified gust which threatens the precise control of intricate maneuvers. By tracking the 3D dynamics of bees flying through gusts, we determined the sequences of motion that permit flight in three disturbance conditions. Bees repetitively executed a series of passive impulsive maneuvers followed by active recovery maneuvers. Impulsive motion was unique in each gust direction, maintaining control purely by passive manipulation of the body. Bees pitched up and slowed-down at the beginning of recovery in every disturbance, followed by corrective maneuvers which brought attitudes back to their original state. Bees were displaced the most by the sideward gust, displaying large lateral translations and roll deviations. Upward gusts were easier for bees to fly through, causing only minor flight changes and minimal recovery times. Downward gusts severely impaired the control response of bees, inflicting strong adverse forces which sharply upset trajectories. Bees used interesting control strategies when flying in each disturbance, offering new insights into insect-scale flapping flight and bio-inspired robotic systems.},

abstract = {Pollen limitation on a plant community level has received little attention, although it might show which pollination-related traits may cause pollen limitation to vary among species. To address several central questions in plant reproductive biology, we investigated pollen limitation in 11 plant species, including visitation and specialisation levels of all species. The female reproductive success of most species within the studied plant community was not pollen limited, but a general tradeoff between seed production and seed weight occurred as a response to supplemental pollination. In contrast to general notion, we did not find that less visited species were most pollen limited. Instead, it appears that species with high visitation rates were most pollen limited. Our study provided conflicting evidence to whether specialisation levels may affect the degree of pollen limitation within the study community. We discuss these findings in the context of recent reviews on the occurrence, causes and consequences of pollen limitation in plants. In particular, we propose that, although pollen limitation is an important phenomenon, 1) the majority of species within a plant community may not experience pollen limitation at a given moment, 2) that common notions of which plant species should experience pollen limited reproductive success do not hold true in the studied plant community, and 3) that offspring quality is as likely affected by surplus pollen loads as is the number of offspring.},

abstract = {Behavioural control in many animals involves complex mechanisms with intricate sensory-motor feedback loops. Modelling allows functional aspects to be captured without relying on a description of the underlying complex, and often unknown, mechanisms. A wide range of engineering techniques are available for modelling, but their ability to describe time-continuous processes is rarely exploited to describe sensory-motor control mechanisms in biological systems. We performed a system identification of visual flight speed control in the fruitfly Drosophila, based on an extensive dataset of open-loop responses previously measured under free flight conditions. We identified a second-order under-damped control model with just six free parameters that well describes both the transient and steady-state characteristics of the open-loop data. We then used the identified control model to predict flight speed responses after a visual perturbation under closed-loop conditions and validated the model with behavioural measurements performed in free-flying flies under the same closed-loop conditions. Our system identification of the fruitfly's flight speed response uncovers the high-level control strategy of a fundamental flight control reflex without depending on assumptions about the underlying physiological mechanisms. The results are relevant for future investigations of the underlying neuromotor processing mechanisms, as well as for the design of biomimetic robots, such as micro-air vehicles.},

abstract = {Despite a wealth of evidence demonstrating extraordinary maximal performance, little is known about the routine flight performance of insects. We present a set of techniques for benchmarking performance characteristics of insects in free flight, demonstrated using a model species, and comment on the significance of the performance observed. Free-flying blowflies (Calliphora vicina) were filmed inside a novel mirrored arena comprising a large (1.6 m1.6 m1.6 m) corner-cube reflector using a single high-speed digital video camera (250 or 500 fps). This arrangement permitted accurate reconstruction of the flies' 3-dimensional trajectories without the need for synchronisation hardware, by virtue of the multiple reflections of a subject within the arena. Image sequences were analysed using custom-written automated tracking software, and processed using a self-calibrating bundle adjustment procedure to determine the subject's instantaneous 3-dimensional position. We illustrate our method by using these trajectory data to benchmark the routine flight performance envelope of our flies. Flight speeds were most commonly observed between 1.2 ms(-1) and 2.3 ms(-1), with a maximum of 2.5 ms(-1). Our flies tended to dive faster than they climbed, with a maximum descent rate (-2.4 ms(-1)) almost double the maximum climb rate (1.2 ms(-1)). Modal turn rate was around 240 degrees s(-1), with maximal rates in excess of 1700 degrees s(-1). We used the maximal flight performance we observed during normal flight to construct notional physical limits on the blowfly flight envelope, and used the distribution of observations within that notional envelope to postulate behavioural preferences or physiological and anatomical constraints. The flight trajectories we recorded were never steady: rather they were constantly accelerating or decelerating, with maximum tangential accelerations and maximum centripetal accelerations on the order of 3 g.},

abstract = {It is clear that the majority of flowering plants are pollinated by insects and other animals, with a minority utilising abiotic pollen vectors, mainly wind. However there is no accurate published calculation of the proportion of the ca 352 000 species of angiosperms that interact with pollinators. Widely cited figures range from 67{\%} to 96{\%} but these have not been based on firm data. We estimated the number and proportion of flowering plants that are pollinated by animals using published and unpublished community-level surveys of plant pollination systems that recorded whether each species present was pollinated by animals or wind. The proportion of animal-pollinated species rises from a mean of 78{\%} in temperate-zone communities to 94{\%} in tropical communities. By correcting for the latitudinal diversity trend in flowering plants, we estimate the global number and proportion of animal pollinated angiosperms as 308 006, which is 87.5{\%} of the estimated species-level diversity of flowering plants. Given current concerns about the decline in pollinators and the possible resulting impacts on both natural communities and agricultural crops, such estimates are vital to both ecologists and policy makers. Further research is required to assess in detail the absolute dependency of these plants on their pollinators, and how this varies with latitude and community type, but there is no doubt that plant-pollinator interactions play a significant role in maintaining the functional integrity of most terrestrial ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

abstract = {How do animals regulate self-movement despite large variation in the luminance contrast of the environment? Insects are capable of regulating flight speed based on the velocity of image motion, but the mechanisms for this are unclear. The Hassenstein-Reichardt correlator model and elaborations can accurately predict responses of motion detecting neurons under many conditions but fail to explain the apparent lack of spatial pattern and contrast dependence observed in freely flying bees and flies. To investigate this apparent discrepancy, we recorded intracellularly from horizontal-sensitive (HS) motion detecting neurons in the hoverfly while displaying moving images of natural environments. Contrary to results obtained with grating patterns, we show these neurons encode the velocity of natural images largely independently of the particular image used despite a threefold range of contrast. This invariance in response to natural images is observed in both strongly and minimally motion-adapted neurons but is sensitive to artificial manipulations in contrast. Current models of these cells account for some, but not all, of the observed insensitivity to image contrast. We conclude that fly visual processing may be matched to commonalities between natural scenes, enabling accurate estimates of velocity largely independent of the particular scene.},

In contrast with previous IBVS methods for underactuated UAVs, which used spherical image moments as visual features, the proposed controller makes use of appropriately defined perspective moments. As a consequence, we gain a clear improvement in performance, as satisfactory trajectories are obtained in both image and Cartesian space. In addition, an adaptation mechanism is included in the controller to achieve robust performance in spite of uncertainties related to the depth of the image features and to the dynamics of the robot. Simulation results in both nominal and perturbed conditions are presented to validate the proposed method.},

abstract = {Many animals rely on movement for survival and reproduction. Directed movements incur metabolic costs, however, and animals adjust their behaviour to optimize energy expenditures in different abiotic conditions. Physical flows and solar radiation vary over time and space and influence animal behaviour at multiple spatiotemporal scales. Here, I quantify the effects of wind speed, wind direction, ambient temperature and sun position on the fine-scale movement ecology and perch orientation of a widespread damselfly, Enallagma doubledayi. Through field observations, I found that damselflies fly, forage and engage competitors in territorial interactions more often in calm rather than windy conditions. Furthermore, perched damselflies exhibit rheotaxis, in which individuals typically face into the wind, presumably to minimize biomechanical costs associated with drag and possibly to detect inbound prey on the water surface and in the air column. In contrast, ambient temperature and the position of the sun were largely unassociated with activity levels and damselfly orientation. At higher ambient temperatures , however, perched odonates faced the sun with increasing consistency, perhaps to thermoregulate by minimizing exposure to solar radiation. Taken together, these findings suggest that damselflies preferentially fly when the ratio of animal speed to wind speed is high and adjust their perch orientation to minimize energy loss. These findings strengthen conceptual links between activity budgets and perch orientation strategies among animals in variable abiotic conditions.},

abstract = {Bumblebee detection of a flat circular disc (two-dimensional (2D) presentation) and a disc which was presented 10 cm in front of a structured background (and thus provided three-dimensional (3D) cues) was compared. A dual choice test using a Y-maze apparatus was conducted to estimate the minimum visual angle at which the bees were able to detect the disc. At large visual angles of 15, 10 and 5° bees' performance between the 2D and the 3D presentation did not differ. However, when the disc subtended 3° at the bee's eye, the bees performed significantly better when 3D information was available. Overall, bees were able to detect a target subtending a 40{\%} smaller visual angle when it was presented in front of the structured background compared to a 2D presentation. This suggests that previous reports on the limits of target detection in bees using flat stimuli might have underestimated the bees' ability to locate small flowers under natural conditions. Bees use motion parallax, i.e. the apparent relative motion of a stationary object against a background, for perceiving the third dimension. Our data suggest that bumblebees can integrate information from at least two types of feature detectors, motion and area, to improve single target detection.},

abstract = {Echolocation signals of horseshoe bats (Rhinolophidae) consist of a relatively long component of constant frequency (CF) which is preceded by an initial frequency-modulated (iFM) component and followed by a terminal frequency-modulated (tFM) component. To examine the role of these components in echolocation, four bats were trained to fly from a perch to a landing bar. A dual camera system allowed reconstruction of the flight paths in three dimensions. Echolocation signals were recorded, analyzed, and correlated with the flight behavior of the bats. It was confirmed that during flight the bats compensate the Doppler shifts which are produced by their own flight movement. In free flight they emit per wing beat one single signal of long duration, with little variation in the three signal components. In approach flight the bats reduce pulse duration and interval with decreasing target range. The iFM is not varied with respect to target range, suggesting that this component plays little role in the processing of echolocating a target of interest. The bandwidth of the tFM component is increased while its duration is shortened in proportion to decreasing target range, so that the signal-echo overlap of the FM component is avoided down to a target distance of 15 cm. These concurrent changes suggest that the tFM component is used for ranging. During the last 60 cm of the approach the bats compensated for the increase of echo SPL by lowering the emission level of the CF component by 6-9 dB and that of the tFM component by 9-11 dB per halving of range. The specific signal structure of horseshoe bats is discussed as an adaptation for the hunting of fluttering insects in highly cluttered environments.},

abstract = {To control flight, insects rely on the pattern of visualmotion generated on the retina as they move through the environment.When light levels fall, vision becomes less reliable and flight control thus becomes more challenging. Here, we investigated the effect of light intensity on flight control by filming the trajectories of free-flying bumblebees (Bombus terrestris, Linnaeus 1758) in an experimental tunnel at different light levels. As light levels fell, flight speed decreased and the flight trajectories became more tortuous but the bees were still remarkably good at centring their flight about the tunnel's midline. To investigate whether this robust flight performance can be explained by visual adaptations in the bumblebee retina, we also examined the response speedof thegreen-sensitivephotoreceptorsat thesamelight intensities. We found that the response speed of the photoreceptors significantly decreased as light levels fell. This indicates that bumblebees have both behavioural (reduction in flight speed) and retinal (reduction in response speed of the photoreceptors) adaptations to allowthemto fly in dimlight. However, the more tortuous flight paths recorded in dim light suggest that these adaptations do not support flight with the same precision during the twilight hours of the day.},

In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the wingbeat rhythm is generated myogenically by stretch-activated muscles and hence independently from direct neural input. In this study, we explored if generation and cycle-by-cycle control of Drosophila's wingbeat are functionally separated, or if the steering muscles instead couple into the myogenic rhythm as a weak forcing of a limit cycle oscillator. We behaviourally tested tethered flying flies for characteristic properties of limit cycle oscillators. To this end, we mechanically stimulated the fly's 'gyroscopic' organs, the halteres, and determined the phase relationship between the wing motion and stimulus. The flies synchronized with the stimulus for specific ranges of stimulus amplitude and frequency, revealing the characteristic Arnol'd tongues of a forced limit cycle oscillator. Rapid periodic modulation of the wingbeat frequency prior to locking demonstrates the involvement of the fast steering muscles in the observed control of the wingbeat frequency. We propose that the mechanical forcing of a myogenic limit cycle oscillator permits flies to avoid the comparatively slow control based on a neural central pattern generator.},

Here we study a ‘streamlining' response in honeybees, whereby honeybees raise their abdomen to reduce drag. We find that this response, which was recently reported to be mediated by optic flow, is also strongly modulated by the presence of air flow simulating a head wind. The Johnston's organs in the antennae were found to play a role in the measurement of the air speed that is used to control the streamlining response. The response to a combination of visual motion and wind is complex and can be explained by a model that incorporates a non-linear combination of the two stimuli. The use of visual and mechanosensory cues increases the strength of the streamlining response when the stimuli are present concurrently. We propose this multisensory integration will make the response more robust to transient disturbances in either modality.},

abstract = {Empirical data about food size carried by central-place foragers do not often fit with the optimum predicted by classical foraging theory. Traditionally, biotic constraints such as predation risk and competition have been proposed to explain this inconsistency, leaving aside the possible role of abiotic factors. Here we documented how wind affects the load size of a central-place forager (leaf-cutting ants) through a mathematical model including the whole foraging process. The model showed that as wind speed at ground level increased from 0 to 2 km/h, load size decreased from 91 to 30 mm2, a prediction that agreed with empirical data from windy zones, highlighting the relevance of considering abiotic factors to predict foraging behavior. Furthermore, wind reduced the range of load sizes that workers should select to maintain a similar rate of food intake and decreased the foraging rate by ∼70{\%} when wind speed increased 1 km/h. These results suggest that wind could reduce the fitness of colonies and limit the geographic distribution of leaf-cutting ants. The developed model offers a complementary explanation for why load size in central-place foragers may not fit theoretical predictions and could serve as a basis to study the effects of other abiotic factors that influence foraging.},

These new damping models offer a means to predict manoeuvrability and stability for a wide variety of flying animals using prior reports of the morphology and flapping motions of these species.

abstract = {Motion in depth results in radial optic-flow patterns. Forward motion results in radially expanding patterns, whereas backward motion generates contracting patterns. Radial optic-flow patterns are typically represented with a positive speed gradient, ie zero speed at the point of fixation, and maximum speed at the periphery. However, the actual speed profile in such a stimulus will depend upon the relative depth of objects in the scene. Using large-field stimuli (82 deg diameter) we determined relative sensitivities to radial expansion and contraction patterns and also to various types of speed gradients: positive, negative, random, and flat. We found that, even when large-field stimuli are used, observers are more sensitive to radially contracting patterns than to expanding patterns. Sensitivity to the positive speed gradient was not consistently different from either the negative or random gradients. Sensitivity to the flat gradient depended upon the speed of the stimuli. The finding of greater sensitivity to radial contraction is discussed in terms of the functional requirements involved in the use of optic-flow signals in maintaining balance. On the basis of the present findings, the utility of comparing psychophysical results based on thresholds against physiological data based on suprathreshold stimuli is also discussed.},

abstract = {Because of the relatively high flapping frequency associated with hovering insects and flapping wing micro-air vehicles (FWMAVs), dynamic stability analysis typically involves direct averaging of the time-periodic dynamics over a flapping cycle. However, direct application of the averaging theorem may lead to false conclusions about the dynamics and stability of hovering insects and FWMAVs. Higher-order averaging techniques may be needed to understand the dynamics of flapping wing flight and to analyze its stability. We use second-order averaging to analyze the hovering dynamics of five insects in response to high-amplitude, high-frequency, periodic wing motion. We discuss the applicability of direct averaging versus second-order averaging for these insects.},

Here we examine the properties of this visually driven `odometer', by training bees to fly to a feeder in a tunnel lined with a range of different visual patterns, and analysing their dances when they return to the hive. We find that the odometric signal is relatively unaffected by variations in the contrast and spatial frequency content of the patterns. Furthermore, a strong signal is generated even when the walls or the floor of the tunnel provide only weak optic-flow cues. Thus, distance flown is measured by a visually driven odometer that is surprisingly robust to variations in the texture or sparseness of the visual environment through which the bee flies.},

abstract = {The flight of insects has fascinated physicists and biologists for more than a century. Yet, until recently, researchers were unable to rigorously quantify the complex wing motions of flapping insects or measure the forces and flows around their wings. However, recent developments in high-speed videography and tools for computational and mechanical modeling have allowed researchers to make rapid progress in advancing our understanding of insect flight. These mechanical and computational fluid dynamic models, combined with modern flow visualization techniques, have revealed that the fluid dynamic phenomena underlying flapping flight are different from those of non-flapping, 2-D wings on which most previous models were based. In particular, even at high angles of attack, a prominent leading edge vortex remains stably attached on the insect wing and does not shed into an unsteady wake, as would be expected from non-flapping 2-D wings. Its presence greatly enhances the forces generated by the wing, thus enabling insects to hover or maneuver. In addition, flight forces are further enhanced by other mechanisms acting during changes in angle of attack, especially at stroke reversal, the mutual interaction of the two wings at dorsal stroke reversal or wing-wake interactions following stroke reversal. This progress has enabled the development of simple analytical and empirical models that allow us to calculate the instantaneous forces on flapping insect wings more accurately than was previously possible. It also promises to foster new and exciting multi-disciplinary collaborations between physicists who seek to explain the phenomenology, biologists who seek to understand its relevance to insect physiology and evolution, and engineers who are inspired to build micro-robotic insects using these principles. This review covers the basic physical principles underlying flapping flight in insects, results of recent experiments concerning the aerodynamics of insect flight, as well as the different approaches used to model these phenomena.},

abstract = {The visual cue of optical flow plays an important role in the navigation of flying insects, and is increasingly studied for use by small flying robots as well. A major problem is that successful optical flow control seems to require distance estimates, while optical flow is known to provide only the ratio of velocity to distance. In this article, a novel, stability-based strategy is proposed for monocular distance estimation, relying on optical flow maneuvers and knowledge of the control inputs (efference copies). It is shown analytically that given a fixed control gain, the stability of a constant divergence control loop only depends on the distance to the approached surface. At close distances, the control loop starts to exhibit self-induced oscillations. The robot can detect these oscillations and hence be aware of the distance to the surface. The proposed stability-based strategy for estimating distances has two main attractive characteristics. First, self-induced oscillations can be detected robustly by the robot and are hardly influenced by wind. Second, the distance can be estimated during a zero divergence maneuver, i.e., around hover. The stability-based strategy is implemented and tested both in simulation and on board a Parrot AR drone 2.0. It is shown that the strategy can be used to: (1) trigger a final approach response during a constant divergence landing with fixed gain, (2) estimate the distance in hover, and (3) estimate distances during an entire landing if the robot uses adaptive gain control to continuously stay on the 'edge of oscillation.'},

abstract = {The parasitic mite Varroa destructor is an important contributor to the high losses of western honeybees. Forager bees from Varroa -infested colonies show reduced homing and flight capacity; it is not known whether flight manoeuvrability and related learning capability are also affected. Here, we test how honeybees from Varroa -infested and control colonies fly in an environment that is unfamiliar at the beginning of each experimental day. Using stereoscopic high-speed videography, we analysed 555 landing manoeuvres recorded during 12 days of approximately 5 h in length. From this, we quantified landing success as percentage of successful landings, and assessed how this changed over time. We found that the forager workforce of Varroa -infested colonies did not improve their landing success over time, while for control bees landing success improved with approximately 10{\%} each hour. Analysis of the landing trajectories showed that control bees improved landing success by increasing the ratio between in-flight aerodynamic braking and braking at impact on the landing platform; bees from Varroa -infested colonies did not increase this ratio over time. The Varroa -induced detriment to this landing skill-learning capability might limit forager bees from Varroa -infested colonies to adapt to new or challenging conditions; this might consequently contribute to Varroa -induced mortality of honeybee colonies.},

We investigated the visual information and the control strategies used to guide both the head and the hand on approach to a target in a locomotion-to-reach task. In this study, participants were required to locomote in the dark to a lit target in three different conditions: monocular vision/target with image size, binocular vision/target with image size, and binocular vision/point-light target (without image size). In task one, participants brought their eyes to the target. In task two, participants brought their outstretched hand to the target. Movement trajectories for both tasks were analyzed. Results show that participants were significantly more accurate when binocular information was present. In both tasks, participants were found to use a proportional rate control strategy rather than a constant $\tau$̇ strategy. In the walk-to-reach task, they used monocular and/or binocular $\tau$ information to guide the head and then switched to using relative disparity $\tau$ to guide the hand to final target acquisition, switching when the hand centric $\tau$ became less than the head centric $\tau$. Dynamical models of the information and control strategies were used to perform simulations that were found to fit the data well. The conclusion is that proportional rate control is used sequentially with head centric, then hand-centric $\tau$-based information, using at each moment the $\tau$ with the smallest value. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {The natural wind environment that volant insects encounter is unsteady and highly complex, posing significant flight control and stability challenges. Unsteady airflows can range from structured chains of discrete vortices shed in the wake of an object to fully developed chaotic turbulence. It is critical to understand the flight control strategies insects employ to safely navigate in natural environments. We combined experiments on free flying bumblebees with high fidelity numerical simulations and lower order modeling to identify the salient mechanics that mediate insect flight in unsteady winds. We trained bumblebees to fly upwind towards an artificial flower in a wind tunnel under steady wind and in a von Karman street (23Hz) formed in the wake of a cylinder. The bees displayed significantly higher movement in the unsteady vortex street compared to steady winds. Correlation analysis revealed that at lower frequencies, less than 10 Hz, in both steady and unsteady winds the bees mediated lateral movement with body roll, typical casting motion. At higher frequencies in unsteady winds there was a negative correlation between body roll and lateral accelerations. Numerical simulations of a bumblebee in similar conditions permitted the separation of the passive and active components of the flight trajectories. Comparison between the free-flying and numerical bees revealed a novel mechanism that enables bees to passively ride out high frequency perturbations while performing active maneuvers and corrections at lower frequencies. The capacity of maintaining stability by combining passive and active modes at different timescales provides a viable means for volant animals and machines to tackle the control challenges posed by complex airflows.},

Compared to the compound eye of the worker honeybee Apis mellifera and the diurnal halictid bee Lasioglossum leucozonium, the eye of M. genalis shows specific retinal and optical adaptations for vision in dim light. The major anatomical adaptations within the eye of the nocturnal bee are (1) nearly twofold larger ommatidial facets and (2) a 4–5 times wider rhabdom diameter than found in the diurnal bees studied. Optically, the apposition eye of M. genalis is 27 times more sensitive to light than the eyes of the diurnal bees. This increased optical sensitivity represents a clear optical adaptation to low light intensities. Although this unique nocturnal apposition eye has a greatly improved ability to catch light, a 27-fold increase in sensitivity alone cannot account for nocturnal vision at light intensities that are 8 log units dimmer than during daytime. New evidence suggests that additional neuronal spatial summation within the first optic ganglion, the lamina, is involved.},

During high-speed wall following, a cockroach holds its antenna relatively still at the base while the flagellum bends in response to upcoming protrusions. We present a simple mechanosensory model for the task-level dynamics of wall following. In the model a torsional, mass-damper system describes the cockroach's turning dynamics, and a simplified antenna measures distance from the cockroach's centerline to a wall. The model predicts that stabilizing neural feedback requires both proportional feedback (difference between the actual and desired distance to wall) and derivative feedback (velocity of wall convergence) information from the antenna. To test this prediction, we fit a closed-loop proportional-derivative control model to trials in which blinded cockroaches encountered an angled wall (30° or 45°) while running. We used the average state of the cockroach in each of its first four strides after first contacting the angled wall to predict the state in each subsequent stride. Nonlinear statistical regression provided best-fit model parameters. We rejected the hypothesis that proportional feedback alone was sufficient. A derivative (velocity) feedback term in the control model was necessary for stability.},

abstract = {To control flight, flying insects extract information from the pattern of visual motion generated during flight, known as optic flow. To regulate their ground speed, insects such as honeybees and Drosophila hold the rate of optic flow in the axial direction (front-to-back) constant. A consequence of this strategy is that its performance varies with the minimum viewing angle (the deviation from the frontal direction of the longitudinal axis of the insect) at which changes in axial optic flow are detected. The greater this angle, the later changes in the rate of optic flow, caused by changes in the density of the environment, will be detected. The aim of the present study is to examine the mechanisms of ground speed control in bumblebees and to identify the extent of the visual range over which optic flow for ground speed control is measured. Bumblebees were trained to fly through an experimental tunnel consisting of parallel vertical walls. Flights were recorded when (1) the distance between the tunnel walls was either 15 or 30cm, (2) the visual texture on the tunnel walls provided either strong or weak optic flow cues and (3) the distance between the walls changed abruptly halfway along the tunnel's length. The results reveal that bumblebees regulate ground speed using optic flow cues and that changes in the rate of optic flow are detected at a minimum viewing angle of 23-30deg., with a visual field that extends to approximately 155deg. By measuring optic flow over a visual field that has a low minimum viewing angle, bumblebees are able to detect and respond to changes in the proximity of the environment well before they are encountered. {\textcopyright} 2010.

Bees extend their hindlegs ventrally at higher speeds, improving roll stability but also increasing body drag and associated power requirements by 30{\%}. Despite the energetic cost, we observed this stability-enhancing behavior in 10 euglossine species from 3 different genera, spanning an order of magnitude in body size. A field experiment in which we altered the level of turbulence demonstrates that flight instability and maximum flight speed are directly related to flow variability. The effect of environmental turbulence on flight stability is thus an important and previously unrecognized determinant of flight performance.},

abstract = {Flying insects have evolved sophisticated sensory-motor systems, and here we argue that such systems are used to keep upright against intrinsic flight instabilities. We describe a theory that predicts the instability growth rate in body pitch from flapping-wing aerodynamics and reveals two ways of achieving balanced flight: active control with sufficiently rapid reactions and passive stabilization with high body drag. By glueing magnets to fruit flies and perturbing their flight using magnetic impulses, we show that these insects employ active control that is indeed fast relative to the instability. Moreover, we find that fruit flies with their control sensors disabled can keep upright if high-drag fibres are also attached to their bodies, an observation consistent with our prediction for the passive stability condition. Finally, we extend this framework to unify the control strategies used by hovering animals and also furnish criteria for achieving pitch stability in flapping-wing robots.},

abstract = {Differences in the foraging behavior of B. terricola workers on white clover, Trifolium repens, were examined on previously unvisited (filled) and depleted flowers, and as a function of flower-head density. 1. The number of florets visited per unit time was independent of flower head density from 20 to at least 290 heads/m2, in part because the bees utilized more florets per head at low flower head densities, and also because they approached but rejected more flower heads at high rather than at low flower head densities. 2. Previously visited clover-heads were approached but often rejected, while unvisited heads were not rejected. 3. The bees behaved markedly different while foraging in patches of flowers which were available to all foragers, than in those which had been screened and contained on the average 3.9 times more sugar; they tendent to move through depleted areas and to concentrate in rich areas. On successive flower-head visits in depleted areas they moved more forward than backward (82{\%} vs. 18{\%}), while in rich areas they tended to move almost as much backward as forward 47{\%} vs. 53{\%}). 4. The distances of inter-head moves were approximately twice as long in depleted as in rich areas. 5. The bees visited almost as many florets per unit time in the rich as in the depleted areas (32 vs. 35 per min). But in the rich patches they probed on the average into 11.6 florets per head in contrast to only 2.3 florets per depleted head. 6. In an experiment with B. vagans workers foraging from Aconitum napellus inflorescences, the bees did not reject previously visited flowers, and they moved upward in successive flower visits on inverted as well as on unaltered inflorescences. On horizontal inflorescences they moved both right and left. The movements are not a direct response to nectar differences, nor to differences in average nectar distributions. The systematic foraging behavior on vertical inflorescences may thus be a mechanism of reducing the revisiting of just-emptied flowers. {\textcopyright} 1979 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Vision is a key sensory modality for flying insects, playing an important role in guidance, navigation and control. Here, we use a virtual-reality flight simulator to measure the optomotor responses of the hawkmoth Hyles lineata, and use a published linear-time invariant model of the flight dynamics to interpret the function of the measured responses in flight stabilization and control. We recorded the forces and moments produced during oscillation of the visual field in roll, pitch and yaw, varying the temporal frequency, amplitude or spatial frequency of the stimulus. The moths' responses were strongly dependent upon contrast frequency, as expected if the optomotor system uses correlation-type motion detectors to sense self-motion. The flight dynamics model predicts that roll angle feedback is needed to stabilize the lateral dynamics, and that a combination of pitch angle and pitch rate feedback is most effective in stabilizing the longitudinal dynamics. The moths' responses to roll and pitch stimuli coincided qualitatively with these functional predictions. The moths produced coupled roll and yaw moments in response to yaw stimuli, which could help to reduce the energetic cost of correcting heading. Our results emphasize the close relationship between physics and physiology in the stabilization of insect flight.},

A review of existing studies, mostly involving crops, reveals opportunities for research exploiting recent advances in microclimatic technique. Intrafloral temperatures are modified in “disc,” “bowl-shaped,” “microgreenhouse,” “hairy hssit trap,” “hanging bell,” and thermogenic flowers. Protection from free water or extreme humidities is achieved by floral structures, movements, and patterns of wettability. Microclimate influences the timing of flower-opening, anther extrusion and dehiscence, the survival and germination of pollen grains, and the exposure and receptivity of the style. Weather- related effects on pollinator activity operate indirectly through floral reward (the secretion rate and sugar concentration of nectar, and die release, texture, and perhaps digestibility of pollen) or direcdy through the hygrothermal balance of the insect or bird, to an extent that depends on the shape of the flower and the degree of endothermy of the pollinator. We consider whether recognition of microclimatic constraints can help growers manage pollination systems. {\textcopyright} 1990 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Abstract. Thermal constraints on flight acivity limit the pollinating effectiveness of bees. Each species of social bee has a microclimatic ‘window' within which foraging flight can be sustained. To predict whether a given species of social bee is worth testing as a pollinator in a given climate, it is useful to know at least the lower limits of that microclimatic ‘window'. We consider how information from a series of bee counts through a day can be used to characterize a bee species in terms of activity/microclimate relations as a basis for predicting the diel pattern of foraging activity of a bee introduced into a new climate as a pollinator. We discuss the relative merits of bee counts at a foraging patch and counts based on hive traffic as indices of the proportion of bees active. We suggest that the activity/microclimate relations of a species be expressed in terms of the lower threshold black globe temperature for flight activity. Black globe temperature, Tg, is easily measured with inexpensive equipment, and can substitute for measurements of ambient temperature and radiation as a predictor of diel patterns of bee activity. We use examples of field data to explore the relationship between microclimate and activity for the honeybee Apis mellifera and several species of bumblebee, Bombus. Regression analysis is used to relate activity to Tg and to identify the lower temperature threshold for activity from field bee counts. In field studies analysed here, the bumblebees Bombus terrestrisllucorum, B.pascuorum and B.hortorum began foraging at lower temperatures than honey‐bees or B.lapidarius.

abstract = {Flying insects use the optic flow to navigate safely in unfamiliar environments, especially by adjusting their speed and their clearance from surrounding objects. It has not yet been established, however, which specific parts of the optical flow field insects use to control their speed. With a view to answering this question, freely flying honeybees were trained to fly along a specially designed tunnel including two successive tapering parts: the first part was tapered in the vertical plane and the second one, in the horizontal plane. The honeybees were found to adjust their speed on the basis of the optic flow they perceived not only in the lateral and ventral parts of their visual field, but also in the dorsal part. More specifically, the honeybees' speed varied monotonically, depending on the minimum cross-section of the tunnel, regardless of whether the narrowing occurred in the horizontal or vertical plane. The honeybees' speed decreased or increased whenever the minimum cross-section decreased or increased. In other words, the larger sum of the two opposite optic flows in the horizontal and vertical planes was kept practically constant thanks to the speed control performed by the honeybees upon encountering a narrowing of the tunnel. The previously described ALIS (“AutopiLot using an Insect-based vision System”) model nicely matches the present behavioral findings. The ALIS model is based on a feedback control scheme that explains how honeybees may keep their speed proportional to the minimum local cross-section of a tunnel, based solely on optic flow processing, without any need for speedometers or rangefinders. The present behavioral findings suggest how flying insects may succeed in adjusting their speed in their complex foraging environments, while at the same time adjusting their distance not only from lateral and ventral objects but also from those located in their dorsal visual field.},

These inverted landing maneuvers are among the most remarkable aerobatic feats, yet the full range of these behaviors and their underlying sensorimotor processes remain largely unknown. Here, we report that successful inverted landing in flies involves a serial sequence of well-coordinated behavioral modules, consisting of an initial upward acceleration followed by rapid body rotation and leg extension, before terminating with a leg-assisted body swing pivoted around legs firmly attached to the ceiling. Statistical analyses suggest that rotational maneuvers are triggered when flies' relative retinal expansion velocity reaches a threshold. Also, flies exhibit highly variable pitch and roll rates, which are strongly correlated to and likely mediated by multiple sensory cues. When flying with higher forward or lower upward velocities, flies decrease the pitch rate but increase the degree of leg-assisted swing, thereby leveraging the transfer of body linear momentum.},

abstract = {To answer the question whether flowers wave to attract pollinators, we determine: (1) the heritability of floral mobility; (2) whether wavy flowers attract more insects; (3) does the duration of pollination affect seed set; and (4) the relationship between seed set and floral mobility. The pollination ecology of Silene maritima was investigated. Flowers on stalks of different waviness were used to investigate the effect of floral movement on pollinator visits. There is heritable variation in both direct and indirect estimates of floral mobility. The highest insect total visitation times were associated with medium length thin stalks that were visited more frequently and by more insect species. Although mean individual visit durations were less than those of less mobile flowers, this was compensated for by increased visits. Observations of controlled pollinations show that when the visit times are low, so is seed set and therefore low and high mobility flowers might suffer from reduced fitness. Combining these observations provides a mechanism that could be driving stabilizing selection for flower stalk traits, with a trade-off applying between waving to attract pollinators and not being too mobile as to prevent effective pollination. Further evidence for stabilizing selection is provided by the relationship observed in the field between seed set and floral mobility where the highest levels of fitness was associated with intermediate levels of floral waving. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors.},

The lateral motion of the model bumblebee is unstable at hovering and low flight speed (advance ratio J=0, 0.13), and becomes neutral or weakly stable at medium and high flight speeds (J=0.31-0.57). The instability at hovering and low speed is mainly caused by a positive roll-moment derivative with respect to the side-slip velocity, which is due to the effect of changing the axial velocity of the leading-edge-vortex (LEV) (i.e. the 'lateral wind' due to the side motion of the insect increases the axial velocity of the LEV on one wing and decreases that on the other wing). As flight speed increases, because the mean position of the wings moves more and more backward, the effect of 'changing-LEV-axial-velocity' becomes weaker and weaker and the roll-moment derivative decreases first and then changes its sign to become negative, resulting in the neutrally or weakly stable motion at medium and high flight speeds. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The longitudinal dynamic flight stability of a hovering bumblebee was studied using the method of computational fluid dynamics to compute the aerodynamic derivatives and the techniques of eigenvalue and eigenvector analysis for solving the equations of motion. For the longitudinal disturbed motion, three natural modes were identified: one unstable oscillatory mode, one stable fast subsidence mode and one stable slow subsidence mode. The unstable oscillatory mode consists of pitching and horizontal moving oscillations with negligible vertical motion. The period of the oscillations is 0.32 s (approx. 50 times the wingbeat period of the bumblebee). The oscillations double in amplitude in 0.1 s; coupling of nose-up pitching with forward horizontal motion (and nose-down pitching with backward horizontal motion) in this mode causes the instability. The stable fast subsidence mode consists of monotonic pitching and horizontal motions, which decay to half of the starting values in 0.024 s. The stable slow subsidence mode is mainly a monotonic descending (or ascending) motion, which decays to half of its starting value in 0.37 s. Due to the unstable oscillatory mode, the hovering flight of the bumblebee is dynamically unstable. However, the instability might not be a great problem to a bumblebee that tries to stay hovering: the time for the initial disturbances to double (0.1 s) is more than 15 times the wingbeat period (6.4 ms), and the bumblebee has plenty of time to adjust its wing motion before the disturbances grow large.},

abstract = {After discovering a small drop of food, hungry flies exhibit a peculiar behavior in which they repeatedly stray from, but then return to, the newly discovered resource. To study this behavior in more detail, we tracked hungry Drosophila as they explored a large arena, focusing on the question of how flies remain near the food. To determine whether flies use external stimuli, we individually eliminated visual, olfactory, and pheromonal cues. In all cases, flies still exhibited a centralized search behavior, suggesting that none of these cues are absolutely required for navigation back to the food. To simultaneously eliminate visual and olfactory cues associated with the position of the food, we constructed an apparatus in which the food could be rapidly translated from the center of the arena. Flies continued to search around the original location, even after the food was moved to a new position. A random search model based on measured locomotor statistics could not reproduce the centered nature of the animal's trajectory. We conclude that this behavior is best explained by a form of path integration in which the flies use idiothetic cues to search near the location of the food. We argue that the use of path integration to perform a centered local search is not a specialization of Drosophila but rather represents an ancient behavioral mode that is homologous to the more elaborate foraging strategies of central place foragers such as ants.},

Delayed stall functions during the translational portions of the stroke, when the wings sweep through the air with a large angle of attack. In contrast, rotational circulation and wake capture generate aerodynamic forces during stroke reversals, when the wings rapidly rotate and change direction. In addition to contributing to the lift required to keep an insect aloft, these two rotational mechanisms provide a potent means by which the animal can modulate the direction and magnitude of flight forces during steering maneuvers.

This Commentary provides a summary of the literature on damage-reducing morphological adaptations in wings, covering natural causes of wing collisions, their impact on the structural integrity of wings and associated consequences for both insect flight performance and life expectancy. Data from the literature and our own observations suggest that insects have evolved strategies that (i) reduce the likelihood of wing damage and (ii) allow them to cope with damage when it occurs: damage-related fractures are minimized because wings evolved to be damage tolerant and, in the case of wing damage, insects compensate for the reduced aerodynamic efficiency with dedicated changes in flight kinematics.},

The framework consists of five main components: an articulated rigid-body simulation, a modelof theaerodynamic forcesandmoments, a sensory systems model, acontrol model,andanenvironment model. In the rigid-body simulation the fly is represented by a system of three rigid bodies connected by a pair of actuated ball joints. Ateach instant of the simulation, the aerodynamic forcesandmomentsacting onthe wingsandbodyof the fly are calculated using an empirically derived quasi-steady model. The pattern of wing kinematics is based on data captured from high-speed video sequences. The forces and moments produced by the wings are modulated by ' deforming the base wing kinematics along certain characteristic actuation modes. Models of the fly s visual and mechanosensory systems are used to generate inputs to a controller that sets the magnitude of each actuation mode, thus modulating the forces produced by the wings. This simulation framework provides a quantitative test bed for examining the possible control strategies employed by flying insects. Examples demonstrating pitch rate, velocity, altitude, and flight speed control, as well as visually guided centering in a corridor are presented.},

abstract = {Flying insects achieve flight stabilization and control in a manner that requires only small, specialized neural structures to perform the essential components of sensing and feedback, achieving unparalleled levels of robust aerobatic flight on limited computational resources. An engineering mechanism to replicate these con- trol strategies could provide a dramatic increase in the mobility of small scale aerial robotics, but a formal investigation has not yet yielded tools that both quantitatively and intuitively explain flapping wing flight as an “input-output” relationship. This work uses experimental and simulated measurements of insect flight to cre- ate reduced order flight dynamics models. The framework presented here creates models that are relevant for the study of control properties. The work begins with automated measurement of insect wing motions in free flight, which are then used to calculate flight forces via an empirically-derived aerodynamics model. When paired with rigid body dynamics and experimentally measured state feedback, both the bare airframe and closed loop systems may be analyzed using frequency domain system identification. Flight dynamics models describing maneuvering about hover and cruise conditions are presented for example fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) and blowflies (Calliphorids). The results show that biologically measured feedback paths are appropriate for flight stabilization and sexual dimorphism is only a mi- nor factor in flight dynamics. A method of ranking kinematic control inputs to maximize maneuverability is also presented, showing that the volume of reachable configurations in state space can be dramatically increased due to appropriate choice of kinematic inputs.},

That book can be seen as the synthesis of the many radical ideas he proposed over the previous 30 years – the concept of information and its sufficiency, the necessary link between perception and action, the need to see perception in relation to an animal's particular ecological niche and the meanings (affordances) offered by the visual world. One of the fundamental concepts that lies beyond all of Gibson's thinking is that of optic flow: the constantly changing patterns of light that reach our eyes and the information it provides. My purpose in writing this paper has been to evaluate the legacy of Gibson's conceptual ideas and to consider how his ideas have influenced and changed the way we study perception.},

abstract = {Sensorimotor integration is a field rich in theory backed by a large body of psychophysical evidence. Relating the underlying neural circuitry to these theories has, however, been more challenging. With a wide array of complex behaviors coordinated by their small brains, insects provide powerful model systems to study key features of sensorimotor integration at a mechanistic level. Insect neural circuits perform both hard-wired and learned sensorimotor transformations. They modulate their neural processing based on both internal variables, such as the animal's behavioral state, and external ones, such as the time of day. Here we present some studies using insect model systems that have produced insights, at the level of individual neurons, about sensorimotor integration and the various ways in which it can be modified by context. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Zapotocky2013,
abstract = {In most animals, rhythmic motion is governed by central pattern generators (CPGs) - neural circuits that generate periodic patterned output. Sensory input to the CPG is not necessary to maintain the periodic neural activity, but is known to strongly influence it. For example, proprioceptive afferent input may entrain the neural CPG rhythm to the mechanical resonance frequency of a limb [1]. CPGs have been shown to govern the locomotor rhythms in vertebrates as well as in insects. A CPG governing the flight rhythm, however, has not been identified in flies, which are known for their remarkable flight maneuverability. In flies, the wingbeat rhythm is generated myogenically by stretch-activated power muscles and hence is not directly controlled by neural input. It is therefore unclear if the insights gained for proprioceptive feedback in CPG-based motor systems [1] likewise apply to flight control in flies. In our study, we investigated if and how proprioceptive feedback influences the rhythm of the myogenic wing beat oscillator. We concentrated on mechanosensory input from the halteres - specialized "gyroscopic" sensory organs of flies. The halteres are known to activate the motor neurons of miniscule steering muscles, which in turn modulate the motion of the wings. In our experiments [2], tethered flying fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) were vibrated by a piezoelectric actuator to stimulate the haltere mechanosensory pathways. We used a laser Doppler interferometer to measure the vibrations of the tether resulting from the superposition of the piezo-delivered stimulus and the fly's wing beat. We determined the phase relationship between the wing motion and the mechanical stimulus in each wing stroke and applied an automated synchrogram analysis [3] to detect entrainment and higher-order synchronization. The flies synchronized with the stimulus for specific ranges of stimulus amplitude and frequency, revealing the characteristic Arnol'd tongues of a forced limit cycle oscillator. Our analysis shows that the steering muscles (activated by proprioceptive input) act as a mechanical forcing of the central power muscle oscillator. We propose that the mechanical forcing of a myogenic limit cycle oscillator permits flies to avoid the comparatively slow control based on a neural central pattern generator. In the entrainment study described above, flies were attached to tethers with high resonance frequency and damping coefficient. While experimenting with tethers of varying mechanical properties, however, we observed that the fly's behavior was significantly influenced by the properties of the tether. To systematically explore this influence for a given fly, we altered the tether's resonance frequency by clamping the tether at a different point in each distinct flight test. In these experiments, no piezo stimulus was applied. Yet, when the tether resonance frequency was comparable to the wing beat frequency, the forces from the fly lead to large cumulative motion of the tether and activation of the haltere mechanosensors. The fly therefore received delayed feedback dependent on its previous activity. This lead to a variety of observed dynamical regimes, including the locking of the wing beat frequency to the tether resonance frequency when their initial difference was sufficiently small (similar to limb entrainment in [1]). We were able to reproduce most of the observed dynamical features in a simplified mathematical model of two mutually coupled oscillators: a phase-reduced nonlinear oscillator representing the wing beat and a linear oscillator representing the tether dynamics.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Quasi-steady aerodynamic models play an important role in evaluating aerodynamic performance and conducting design and optimization of flapping wings. The kinematics of flapping wings is generally a resultant motion of wing translation (yaw) and rotation (pitch and roll). Most quasi-steady models are aimed at predicting the lift and thrust generation of flapping wings with prescribed kinematics. Nevertheless, it is insufficient to limit flapping wings to prescribed kinematics only since passive pitching motion is widely observed in natural flapping flights and preferred for the wing design of flapping wing micro air vehicles (FWMAVs). In addition to the aerodynamic forces, an accurate estimation of the aerodynamic torque about the pitching axis is required to study the passive pitching motion of flapping flights. The unsteadiness arising from the wing's rotation complicates the estimation of the centre of pressure (CP) and the aerodynamic torque within the context of quasi-steady analysis. Although there are a few attempts in literature to model the torque analytically, the involved problems are still not completely solved. In this work, we present an analytical quasi-steady model by including four aerodynamic loading terms. The loads result from the wings translation, rotation, their coupling as well as the added-mass effect. The necessity of including all the four terms in a quasi-steady model in order to predict both the aerodynamic force and torque is demonstrated. Validations indicate a good accuracy of predicting the CP, the aerodynamic loads and the passive pitching motion for various Reynolds numbers. Moreover, compared to the existing quasi-steady models, the presented model does not rely on any empirical parameters and thus is more predictive, which enables application to the shape and kinematics optimization of flapping wings.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Abstract. Thermal constraints on flight acivity limit the pollinating effectiveness of bees. Each species of social bee has a microclimatic ‘window' within which foraging flight can be sustained. To predict whether a given species of social bee is worth testing as a pollinator in a given climate, it is useful to know at least the lower limits of that microclimatic ‘window'. We consider how information from a series of bee counts through a day can be used to characterize a bee species in terms of activity/microclimate relations as a basis for predicting the diel pattern of foraging activity of a bee introduced into a new climate as a pollinator. We discuss the relative merits of bee counts at a foraging patch and counts based on hive traffic as indices of the proportion of bees active. We suggest that the activity/microclimate relations of a species be expressed in terms of the lower threshold black globe temperature for flight activity. Black globe temperature, Tg, is easily measured with inexpensive equipment, and can substitute for measurements of ambient temperature and radiation as a predictor of diel patterns of bee activity. We use examples of field data to explore the relationship between microclimate and activity for the honeybee Apis mellifera and several species of bumblebee, Bombus. Regression analysis is used to relate activity to Tg and to identify the lower temperature threshold for activity from field bee counts. In field studies analysed here, the bumblebees Bombus terrestrisllucorum, B.pascuorum and B.hortorum began foraging at lower temperatures than honey‐bees or B.lapidarius.

abstract = {Bees often forage in habitats with cluttered vegetation and unpredictable winds. Navigating obstacles in wind presents a challenge that may be exacerbated by wind-induced motions of vegetation. Although wind-blown vegetation is common in natural habitats, we know little about how the strategies of bees for flying through clutter are affected by obstacle motion and wind. We filmed honeybees Apis mellifera flying through obstacles in a flight tunnel with still air, headwinds or tailwinds. We tested how their ground speeds and centering behavior (trajectory relative to the midline between obstacles) changed when obstacles were moving versus stationary, and how their approach strategies affected flight outcome (successful transit versus collision). We found that obstacle motion affects ground speed: bees flew slower when approaching moving versus stationary obstacles in still air but tended to fly faster when approaching moving obstacles in headwinds or tailwinds. Bees in still air reduced their chances of colliding with obstacles (whether moving or stationary) by reducing ground speed, whereas flight outcomes in wind were not associated with ground speed, but rather with improvement in centering behavior during the approach. We hypothesize that in challenging flight situations (e.g. navigating moving obstacles in wind), bees may speed up to reduce the number of wing collisions that occur if they pass too close to an obstacle. Our results show that wind and obstacle motion can interact to affect flight strategies in unexpected ways, suggesting that wind-blown vegetation may have important effects on foraging behaviors and flight performance of bees in natural habitats.},

abstract = {Inspired by the exceptional flight capabilities of flying insects, the UC Berkeley Micromechanical Flying Insect (MFI) project entails the development of a flapping wing micro aerial vehicle that will be capable of sustained autonomous flight. It has a target size of 25 mm wing span and a mass of 100mg . Biological principles are used for actuation, transmission, sensing, and control of the MFI so that the device will exhibit the same performance merits as those observed in real flying insects. This dissertation first describes the sensing mechanisms used by real insects and then presents formal models of biologically inspired sensory systems including optic flow sensors, angular position sensors, and angular rate sensors. The analysis and simulations of the proposed sensor models suggest the feasibility of using these biomimetic sensors for flight control of a robotic flying insect. It is also demonstrated that a number of insect flight behaviors can be reproduced using simple control schemes based on these sensors. An example of attitude stabilization is given in which a proportional control law using the outputs from the ocelli and halteres as feedback is able to steer the insect toward the upright posture from any initial body orientation and angular velocities. This dissertation also includes the design of an optic flow sensor, an ocelli sensor, a haltere sensor, and a magnetic field sensor for use on the MFI. Preliminary experimental results of these prototype sensors show promising performance. Compared to existing commercial micro sensors, these devices have the advantages of simple structure, easy implementation, simple signal processing, and low power consumption. Therefore, these sensors are particularly appropriate for micro robotic platforms that have limited computational resources, little power budget, and small payload capacity.},

abstract = {We used a dynamically scaled model insect to measure the rotational forces produced by a flapping insect wing. A steadily translating wing was rotated at a range of constant angular velocities, and the resulting aerodynamic forces were measured using a sensor attached to the base of the wing. These instantaneous forces were compared with quasi-steady estimates based on translational force coefficients. Because translational and rotational velocities were constant, the wing inertia was negligible, and any difference between measured forces and estimates based on translational force coefficients could be attributed to the aerodynamic effects of wing rotation. By factoring out the geometry and kinematics of the wings from the rotational forces, we determined rotational force coefficients for a range of angular velocities and different axes of rotation. The measured coefficients were compared with a mathematical model developed for two-dimensional motions in inviscid fluids, which we adapted to the three-dimensional case using blade element theory. As predicted by theory, the rotational coefficient varied linearly with the position of the rotational axis for all angular velocities measured. The coefficient also, however, varied with angular velocity, in contrast to theoretical predictions. Using the measured rotational coefficients, we modified a standard quasi-steady model of insect flight to include rotational forces, translational forces and the added mass inertia. The revised model predicts the time course of force generation for several different patterns of flapping kinematics more accurately than a model based solely on translational force coefficients. By subtracting the improved quasi-steady estimates from the measured forces, we isolated the aerodynamic forces due to wake capture.},

(Sapotaceae), and to examine pollination efficiency of birds and honey bees. Location: An upland heath area on the island of Mauritius, Indian Ocean. Methods: We quantified visitation rates of endemic birds and introduced honey bees at two endemic species of flowering trees. Diurnal variation in nectar standing crop and nectar production was measured. Pollination efficiency of flower visitors was examined using bagging and caging experiments. Results: White-eyes were only nectar-feeding at the two Sideroxylon species early in the morning, stopping when honey bee foraging activity rapidly lowered nectar standing crops. White-eyes continued nectar-feeding at other flowering plant species, exploited less by honey bees, throughout the day. Honey bees were less efficient pollinators of the two Sideroxylon species than white-eyes. Main conclusions: Our results indicate that introduced honey bees could be interfering with endemic interactions between the two Sideroxylon species and the two white-eye species. However, because of lack of a neutral control site without honey bees, we cannot exclude other explanations. We do recommend, although, that honey bees need to be taken into consideration in the future conservation management of Mauritian ecosystems. We suggest that island ecosystems are especially vulnerable to introduced honey bees.},
