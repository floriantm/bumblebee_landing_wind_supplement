This linear regression approximates the optic expansion acceleration with a constant value.

At each condition, we show a box plot and the coefficient of determination ($R^2$) at all transient phases (dots). The median coefficient of determination is above $0.98$ in all tested treatments.}

\subsection{Statistical models}
\label{sec:s3_text_stat_models}

We developed linear mixed-effects models to find how the transient response of the sensorimotor control system of landing bumblebees ($\dot{r}_e$) and the resulting mean accelerations ($\overline{A}_e$) varied with the starting distance from the landing surface ($y_0$), the required step-change in relative rate of expansion ($\Delta r_e$), the final set-point to reach ($r^*$), landing patterns (checkerboard and spoke), environmental light intensities, and the starting condition of the landing maneuver (whether the landing is from a free-flight or after a take-off). We first constructed a full model with aforementioned variables along with their interactions as fixed factors, and with the day of the experiment, the landing approach and the landing side (whether landing disc is located on the hive side or the food source side) as random intercepts. The model dredging revealed that the landing patterns did not affect either of the response variables ($\dot{r}_e$ or $\overline{A}_e$). Moreover, among all interaction terms, only $\text{log}(y_0)\times \text{log}(\Delta r_e)$ term was found to be significant, therefore we used the following reduced model:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:ch03_bbee_rdot_amean_model}
	\begin{array}{lll}
		\!\!\!\!\!\! \log(\dot{r}_{e~i,d,a,s}) \sim N( \!\!\!\!\!
		& \alpha + \alpha_d + \alpha_a + \alpha_s + \beta_1~\log(y_{0~i,d,a,s}) + \beta_2~\textrm{MEDIUMlight}_{i,d,a,s} + \\
		&\beta_3~\textrm{HIGHlight}_{i,d,a,s} + \beta_4~\textrm{fromTakeoff}_{i,d,a,s} + \beta_5~\log(\Delta r_{e~i,d,a,s}) + \\
		&\beta_6~\log(r^*_{i,d,a,s}) + \beta_7~\log(y_{0~i,d,a,s})\times \log(\Delta r_{e~i,d,a,s}),~\sigma^2)
	\end{array}                                          
\end{equation}
where $\dot{r}_{e~i,d,a,s}$, $y_{0~i,d,a,s}$, $\Delta r_{e~i,d,a,s}$, and $r^*_{i,d,a,s}$ are the measurements from the $i$-th entry segment from $d$-th day, $a$-th landing approach and $s$-th landing side, $\alpha$ is the regression intercept for the low light intensity and free-flight starting condition (overall intercept), $\alpha_d$ is the day-specific intercept, $\alpha_a$ is the landing-approach-specific intercept, $\alpha_s$ is the landing-side-specific intercept, $\textrm{MEDIUMlight}_{i,d,a,s}$, $\textrm{HIGHlight}_{i,d,a,s}$ and $\textrm{fromTakeoff}_{i,d,a,s}$ indicate if medium light condition, high light condition and take-off starting condition are present for the $i$-th measurement from $d$-th day, $a$-th landing approach and $s$-th landing side ($0$ = no, $1$ = yes), $\beta_i~\forall i \in \{2,3,4\}$ represent differences of fixed-effects from the overall intercept, $\beta_i~\forall i \in \{1,5,6,7\}$ represent the slopes of different covariates along with an interaction, and $\sigma$ is the residual standard deviation. The similar formula holds for the mean acceleration $\overline{A}_e$ as well. The statistical outputs are given in Tables~\ref{tb:ch03_rdot_modulation} and~\ref{tb:ch03_amean_modulation}.

%We also developed a statistical model to test how the landing performance of bumblebees, measured as the time ($\Delta t$) they take to travel $0.2~m$ (from $y = 0.25~m$ to $y = 0.05~m$), varied in different tested environmental conditions (light conditions and landing patterns) and the landing type (landing from take-off or free-flight). For this purpose, we first constructed a full model with light, pattern and landing type along with their interactions as fixed factors and with the day of the experiment and the landing side as random intercepts. We found that pattern did not affect the travel time. Therefore, we used the following reduced model:
%\begin{equation}
%	\label{eq:ch03_travel_time_model}
%	\begin{array}{lll}
%		\!\!\!\!\!\! \Delta t \sim N( \!\!\!\!\!
%		& \alpha + \alpha_d + \alpha_s + \beta_1~\textrm{MEDIUMlight}_{i,d,s} + 
%		\beta_2~\textrm{HIGHlight}_{i,a,s} + \\
%		& \beta_3~\textrm{fromTakeoff}_{i,d,s},~\sigma^2)
%	\end{array}                                          
%\end{equation}
%The statistical output for travel time in different tested conditions is given in Table~\ref{tb:ch03_travel_time}. 

\subsection{Governing equations for motion at a constant expansion-acceleration}
\label{sec:s3_text_const_rdot_motion}
During entry segments, the motion of an animal towards the landing surface can be well approximated by a motion at a constant expansion-acceleration ($\dot{r}$). Such a motion is described by a following system of equations:
\begin{ceqn}
	\begin{subequations}
		\label{eq:ch03_const_rdot_motion}
		\begin{align}
			V(t) & = - \frac{dy(t)}{dt} \\
			A(t) & =  \frac{dV(t)}{dt} = \dot{r}~y(t) - \frac{V^2(t)}{y(t)} \\
			y(t_0) & = y_0 \text{, and } V(t_0) = (r^*-\Delta r)~y_0
		\end{align}
	\end{subequations}
\end{ceqn}
where $y(t)$, $V(t)$, and $A(t)$ are the distance (in a direction normal to the landing surface), velocity and acceleration of an animal at time $t$, and $r^*$ and $\Delta r_e$ are the new set-point and the required step-change in relative rate of expansion at the moment of switching the set-point ($t_0$).
